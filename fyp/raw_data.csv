13079	63	2.0	-1	2011-10-24	Food is good but service needs improvement.  I ordered a speciality pizza which said one price on the board behind them at the counter.  But when it came time to pay they said the prices have all gone up but they haven't had time to update the price board.  Really?!  Just get up on the chair and change them now!  It was false adervtising at best but more like fraud.  And we're not talking a dollar or 2, try $32 for a special pizza, are they out of their minds?  Good food but not worth the price or hassle of the bad service.
13080	63	3.0	-1	2014-01-26	Nice family restaurant located off of 206. It was a little hard to spot at night time when we were driving in. It's located in a house looking building on the first floor. The seating is limited, and when we arrived looking to be seated, we were confused as to whether the line was for individuals who wanted to order at the counter or for those who were waiting to be seated. There was also no host to greet us or provide direction as to how to go about being seated. We finally had to flag one of the waiters down to seat us. We ordered the buffalo chicken pizza, which was amazing. It's LOADED with pieces of buffalo chicken, with real bleu cheese interspersed. It was extremely filling, so I could barely eat more than 1 slice. The service again was lackluster, as our waiter didn't return to check on us or refill our water until the very end of the meal. To their credit, the restaurant was extremely busy as we arrived on Friday night for dinner. The restaurant itself was quaint, with packaged Italian food items and desserts lining the walls for purchase (including Nutella, of course). The restaurant seemed like a great place for family and friend gatherings, as there were numerous large parties seated around us that were enjoying their meals and drinks (as we discovered, this place is BYOB). Overall, despite the service, I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner and would definitely return. I look forward to trying the Brooklyn pizza next time, which other patrons were raving about around us. Great restaurant for date night!
13081	63	3.0	-1	2011-08-08	Pizza is good, but the food is ridicously expensive. $36 dollars for six slices of pizza.. I won't be going back!
13082	63	3.0	-1	2011-04-01	Pizza is really good. Take out is rough especially on weekends. Order something unique so they can't give it to someone else. If you order a plain pie and they don't know you, you will be waiting. You get a number when you call but it means nothing to them. If you have the time and are patient, it is worth it.
13083	63	4.0	-1	2014-09-18	Best pizza in town! Getting real tired of eating Papa Johns every weekend, so I decided to try a smaller, more localized business. It was definitely some of the best pizza I've had in years! I'll be making a few more visits in the near future!
13084	63	4.0	-1	2014-07-09	Good food, friendly staff.
13085	63	4.0	-1	2012-04-27	"Joe's is the best pizza place in the Belle Mead area. Their ""dinners"" are very good as well. The first question my kids always ask when they are served pizza is, ""Is it Joe's?"" (pizza snobs). Joe's loses a star because most of their sandwiches are just ok. Often times their sandwich issues relate back to the bread. If the bread isn't any good then don't bother making the sandwich."
13086	63	4.0	-1	2011-04-10	My husband and I went to dinner on a Sat. night around 6:30. The place was packed, yet we only waited less than 5 minutes to be seated in the dining room. We brought our own wine, and tried 3 of the Specials offered that night. We were very satisfied with every we ordered.The stuffed Calamari appetizer was as tender and tasty as can be. The salad was offered with a home made white balsamic vinaigrette. We also ordered 2 entrees: the Halibut with artichokes, gaeta olives, tomatoes, and garlic over fresh baby spinach and the Sea Scallops & Shrimp with the home made macaroni. We were able to take our time eating, with ample time in between courses to digest. The atmosphere was as good as the food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. The chef knows how to cook like home! During our visit, on occasion, the chef would walk around the dining room and engage in short conversation with the patrons to make sure everything was alright. Thank you Joe's for a great meal.
13087	63	4.0	-1	2009-03-22	Good find.  Seems to be relatively popular.  We had dinner at 5pm Sunday, and there was a steady stream of people coming in for pickups and the dining room was about 50% full. Calamari was pretty standard stuff - could have been frozen... We had the Brooklyn-style Sicilian pizza.  Pretty good.  Highly seasoned, little greasy.  Crust was nice and crispy, and tomatoes were really good.   Atmosphere was nothing special - framed Italian-themed prints on the walls.  Murals.  Service was serviceable.
13088	63	5.0	-1	2014-11-18	This is the best pizza I've found in this area so far. We would order more if they delivered
13089	63	5.0	-1	2014-11-17	Good value, we love the Brooklyn Pie with wine and beer. We are regulars of Friday night. PS: it's a BYOB
13090	63	5.0	-1	2014-10-29	Best philly cheesesteak in town.
13091	63	5.0	-1	2014-08-13	I am not a pizza fan at all but Joe's pizza is the only pizza I will eat!!!
13092	63	5.0	-1	2014-07-22	Great, small business and many options. Service is what you expect from a pizza place. I have been coming here for years and have never been upset. I normally get take out, but if you choose to dine in, the staff is nice and it's a great dine-in experience overall.
13093	63	5.0	-1	2014-07-04	These guys make the best buffalo chicken pizza I've ever had. I can't even eat buffalo chicken pizza anywhere else anymore because it will inevitably be a disappointment. We get it every time my wife and I come down to visit my in-laws. The tragedy is that my in-laws are moving, so chances are I'll never eat at Joe's again. Curse you Joe's! You've ruined me for buffalo chicken pizza forever!
13094	63	5.0	-1	2014-05-25	Amazing pizza, Brooklyn style is the best!
13095	63	5.0	-1	2013-04-03	Best pizza in town hands dowwn!
13096	63	5.0	-1	2013-02-14	Mmm, mmm, mm!  Do you love pizza?!  I totally do!  Want a recommendation?!  Go to Joe's!  You're gonna LOVE it!  Joe's Pizza is SO mouth-watering!  And the pizza can probably give your taste buds a new BFF.  Trust me, because I must have been there about a million, hundred, and eight times.  And now you'll totally see why the food is so fantastical!   The first reason you should, no matter what, try Joe's is because of the AMAZING fluffy, ooey, gooey cheese!  One bite of that warm gooey cheese you will most likely die just to get more! Another amazingly, perfect, mouth-watering reason to get a slice of Joe's is (of course) because of the delicious, nutritious basil sprinkled all over the delicious, ooey, gooey cheese.  Its like heaven just to chomp on that mouth-watering basil! The tasty, perfect, delicious, marvelous last reason I'm recommending Joe's is because of their tasty, rich, sweet, creamy, fruity italian ice.  Plus its right in the fruit's perfect shell!  For instance, say you get a zesty lemon italian ice.  It wouldn't be in a boring old bowl.  It would be in a lemon shell!  How cool is that?! After all the explaining, I hope you can see why their pizza and italian ice is so good.  I hope your next visit to pizza will be Joe's!  (Because it will BLOW your noodle!)
13097	63	5.0	-1	2012-06-18	BEST PIZZA IN NEW JERSEY! Variations of different pizzas and delicious gourmet pastas and so much more. It's all about the sauce and the fresh picked herbs. Try the Brooklyn slice, yummy! I'm from Italy so I'm very picky with Italian foods. Antoinette
13098	63	5.0	-1	2011-11-03	OMG the Brooklyn Pie is out of this world!!  Thank you Thank you!!
13099	63	2.0	1	2014-09-28	The workers are so rude. They even charged me for plastic plates. They take forever to bring out the food that only tastes mediocre for its price.
13100	63	3.0	1	2014-06-13	Pizza here is ok, nothing to brag about.  Place is always crowded so their business is good.  Ordered a Turkey Hoagie to go and was very disappointed.  I should have checked it before I left and I would have asked for my money back for sure.  They placed only a couple of very thinly sliced pieces of that cheap processed turkey and piled the rest of it with tomatos, onions, and a ton of lettuce.  The sandwich appeared big but they skimp on the meat.  And the sandwich was expensive.  If you go to Krauser's or even Wa Wa, they build a big sandwich with plenty of meat, especially Krauser's and they charge much less for a better sandwich.  Very disappointing!
13101	63	5.0	1	2014-05-29	I had one of the tastiest cheese pie right here at this joint. I still can't forget the taste. I will go back and enjoy one more time then write more.
13102	63	3.0	1	2014-05-21	The food here is very good but the service is horrible.  Have eaten here on 3 occasions and all 3 times had to wait more than 45 minutes for our food.  The last time we waited an hour for our dinner.  Will not return until service improves which is a shame because the food is good.
13103	63	2.0	1	2014-04-29	Here's the deal...they have the pizza down...very good.  Some of the Italian dishes are very good as well.  The service, is very poor.  (VERY poor).  If you call for take out given time for pickup, add an hour.  Seriously, add an hour.  You will be standing with no less than 19 people waiting for your take out, for about an hour past the time you were told it would be ready (Friday and Saturday nights).  It's not a one time experience.  The most recent one, waited the hour extra with boxes of food on counter in front of me.  Told them my number, then asked my number again, told order wasn't ready.  Asked my number again, I looked over box and told them again...said almost.  Asked my number again...moved box to tell them...said soon.  After an hour of waiting...turned out the  box I was staring over and moving to see, in a row of other boxes, was my order.  There are other poor experiences.  Point is, they have issues managing orders...NOT cooking the food. Sometimes the taste of the food isn't worth the stress and that's often the decision why we decide to go elsewhere, because they can't nail the service.  Given the large customer base who do not mind waiting so looong, they probably don't even see reason to improve.
10982	63	4.0	1	2014-04-04	Great Pizza! Buffalo Chicken Pizza is to die for!
13104	63	3.0	1	2013-12-27	Been driving by this place for 13 years, figured is try a pie and a salad. it was about 5:30 and a couple of patrons were eating dinner early. I was early for the pie pickup, i like to hang around and get a vibe on a place anyway.  The place has a homey country store feel, Italian items on the shelves. The pizza is good, and what is unique about their pizza is the aromatic oregano on the pie. Their rice balls were not that good and no sauce was provided in my take order for them. Normally rice balls are served with sauce.
13105	63	1.0	1	2013-10-11	Food is usually good. Service sucks. Waited in restaurant at table for a half hour for cheese pizza and was told they lost the ticket but would start then. We left.
10401	63	5.0	1	2013-07-24	A hidden gem! Very courteous staff with awesome Italian food. Definitely would come again.
13106	63	5.0	1	2013-05-04	Excellent as usual. Calamari and Brooklyn pizza are great. Beautiful new updates of the restaurant. It looks more a restaurant than just a pizzeria but everything comes at a price. I heard prices will go up but you pay for quality.
13107	63	2.0	1	2013-02-25	went there with a party of 5 friday night.  it was pretty crowded and we were told it would be a 20 min wait.  an hour later we were seated.   fifteen minutes after that we were given menus.   about ten min later someone came to take our order. when the food finally came out.  one of the dishes was wrong.  the did correct it pretty quickly.  then then menu said 3 of the orders came with dessert which we were only given after asking about it.  Doubt ill go back.  alfonsos in somerville or lorenzos were much better
13108	63	5.0	1	2013-01-23	There are lots of pizza places in Hillsborough and we drive past many of them to get pizza from Joes.  I grew up in NJ so am very picky about my pizza. One downside is that I'm not a big fan of their hot subs but definitely worthwhile for the pizza.
13109	63	3.0	1	2012-12-29	I'd give this place 4 stars for it's food: especially the sandwiches and panini's it makes, however I can't get over the abrupt service (take out or eat in). I've eaten here probably 6 times either take-out or eat in and it's the same every time. The pizza is just okay, it's not marvelous, the sandwiches are interesting and very good. Likes - The sandwiches - The pizza (at a stretch) Disklikes - The service - The price - its way overpriced for what it is.
13110	63	4.0	1	2012-12-17	Very solid pizza/italian joint. It's obviously the best in the area based on the crowds, and for some reason my mother and step father think the 'Brooklyn Pizza' is the best invention since the bagel guillotine. The Brooklyn Pizza IS pretty good (I guess they make pizza thin, cut it into squares, and use less mozzarella and more parmesan cheese in Brooklyn?). And the rest of the pizzas with the lone exception of chicken as a topping, which was pretty dry in my opinion (...but who orders chicken on a pizza anyway, right?) are very good. I've had pastas/heros/calzones here that were all solid, too. Overall a strong 4 stars.
13111	63	5.0	1	2012-12-14	Great pizza. Love a simple plain cheese pizza eaten fresh at the restaurant. Best in the area.
13112	63	4.0	1	2012-09-02	Great comfort Italian food. I've only had the pizza and the calzones - and both were excellent. Price is reasonable, casual dining, and staff is very friendly. Wish they would offer a spinach and pepperoni calzone - but I'm sure if I asked, they would make it. Just moved to NJ from RI and we just spotted it one day driving around and have been back twice. I'm hooked. Can't wait to try the pasta - it looks fantastic!
13113	63	5.0	1	2012-06-25	Great pizza. Quite literally some of the best pizza I've ever had in all my life. the buffalo chicken pizza is incredible, big juicy piece of buffalo chicken' in creamy buffalo ranch sauce. The original pepperoni is incredible . The full flavor leaves you satisfied after just 1 slice, but Joe's will have you coming back for more in no time.
13114	63	4.0	1	2012-04-15	Best pizza in the area.  We've tried many other places but keep going back to Joe's.  In addition to pizza, we've tried the calzone, stromboli, hot subs and cold subs.  No complaints.  The place is usually hopping on the weekends and they have occasionally given our takeout order to someone else so check your food before heading out the door!  If you're in the area and have a hankering for pizza, go to Joe's.
13115	63	4.0	1	2011-11-04	Pretty amazing Pizza. I had many of their pies when I lived in NJ. Definitely the best pizza I had while I was in NJ. They introduced me to the prosciutto, arugula and cheese Tuscan pizza- delicioso! All their pizza's are good. They have a great variety of traditional styles to newer, interesting pies like a chicken caesar salad pizza. Pasta and other foods were also very good. My daughter had pasta and ate it up right away without fuss (pretty incredible for my 18month old!)
13116	63	5.0	1	2011-07-29	"Excellent pizza and a lot of varieties. Also has wonderful dinners. The vodka sauce and spaghetti with meat balls are excellent. Nice atmosphere. I use to eat here all the time when I lived here. I've moved ti Minnesota but visit NJ once a year. When here I come back to NJ I always come here several times to get my ""fix"" of pizza. 8/5/12 update. Well I am back in NJ and ate here the first and second nights. The food is as good as ever if not even getting better. A very large selection of  of gourmet pizza already made that you can get a slice each of ( 2 slices is my unfortunate max though :) They also have a very large menu with excellent dinners. My wife gets the dinner I have to have pizza though. They renovated the place since the last time I was here and it is very cute and Italian Cafe looking. The staff and owner are very friendly. All talk to you with huge smile. I'd write more but I have to leave to go back for another slice."
13117	63	5.0	1	2011-07-24	"I can honestly say I've only had a ""bite"" of the pizza (which was good) -- but my review is based on the other food I've had - eggplant rollatini and a calzone on two separate occasions.  Both were very delicious.  For some good family pizza/italian food, this place is fantastic.  Really good food.  Atmosphere is nothing special, but the food is worth it.  Very good, will be going back often."
13118	63	3.0	1	2011-06-16	Good pizza, average garlic knots.  Pepperoni roll was alright, but cold.  Service was terrible, it felt like I was inconveniencing them by paying them $30 for lunch for two people.  One of those lunches was an $8 cheese steak.  I'm not sure how 2 slices of pizza, an order of garlic knots, a pepperoni roll and a soda comes to $20.
13119	63	5.0	1	2011-03-08	Best pizza in Hillsborough.  I had another favorite before this one but since trying Joe's, well, needless to say I have never gone anywhere else.  The thick Marguerita pizza is amazingly good, the chicken scampi dish to die for!  I go in and get it weekly.  This place is a must try!
13120	63	4.0	1	2011-01-15	Incredible variety and plenty to choose from.  My personal favorite would have to be their brooklyn style pizza.  All of their pizza is great though.  Great appetizers and service.  Not pricey at all(Except for some specialty pizzas) However, I would NOT recommend placing an order for delivery.  It can take up to over an hour for delivery from this place. Besides the delivery, well worth the price.
13121	63	4.0	1	2009-01-11	"Increible! I just moved to NJ and I'm an instant fan of this place. I wish that italian food, specifically pizza like this was the norm rather than the exception. The pizza here is great in every respect, many of their specialty pizzas are like entrees on crust eg chicken marsala pizza or steak and cheese pizza. I like the atmosphere in the place- it falls somewhere between pizza joint and formal restaurant. Its find your own table, but they serve you.. good stuff I must mention though, that they do not get 5 stars due to a recent experience in which it took an hour from call to payment to get a pizza. for most of that time I was told by the guy behind the counter ""2 more minutes buddy"". Sorry Joes- otherwise you're top notch"
13122	63	4.0	1	2008-02-16	Joe's Pizza is our familie's pizza of choice. It is hugely popular with the locals and pretty much packed over the weekend. You can read a more complete review on my blog.
13123	64	2.0	-1	2014-09-09	I had the capri sadwich.  Mozzarella, tomato, and basil.  For a little over $9 including tax, it wasn't worth it. In Philly, you can get a lot of great sandwiches for $9, and this wasn't one of them. The portion was small. three slices of tomato, three slices of mozz, and three basil leaves.  At the height of the basil and tomato season, this is unacceptable.  And, everything was too cold.  This sandwich is a room temperature sandwich, not a cold sandwich.  Finally, the roast pepper spread overwhelmed the tomato, basil, and mozzarella. Very disappointed.   I saw folks getting a meat based sandwiches, piled high with meat and, as a vegetarian, I can't justify paying the same price for a sandwich, if I am getting half of the food. Oh well, I will not return.
13124	64	5.0	-1	2015-01-03	It's refreshing to be able to go to a sandwich shop free from the corporate feel of a Subway or Au Bon Pain. The sandwich that I ate, the Italian Stallion, was incredible. The size of the sandwich was perfect at just over 9 inches. The bread was fresh. Their homemade spicy mayo sauce that they had was such a great compliment, and the meat itself was fresh and tasted as it would in an Italian Trattoria in Rome. Outside of how delicious the sandwich was, I was pleasantly surprised by how affordable it was. The shop was clean, the tables were original and the staff were very nice.  You could really tell that everyone there was invested in the happiness of the customers and the success of the establishment, unlike corporate sandwich shops I know. I hope Matt & Marie's franchises in New York!
13125	64	5.0	-1	2014-12-30	I'm from NY and have very high standards for sandwiches.  I visit Philly regularly for work and literally go out of my way each time to get a sandwich from Matt & Marie's - it's THAT good!!  Great sandwiches are hard to come by, but they really hit the nail on the head.  I've only been 4-5 times so far, so I still haven't had a chance to try all of their different types of sandwiches, but so far none have disappointed.  Most recently I had the ham sandwich with their home-made mozzarella.  Scrumptious!!!!
13126	64	5.0	-1	2014-09-22	Thank you Matt & Marie for OUTSTANDING FOOD and SERVICE. We are exciting to have your business in ourarea. The food is fresh and always delivered on time. Your staff's desire to meet the customers needs is very refreshing. We look forward to our next lunch with you. Renee
13127	64	5.0	-1	2014-09-02	Great lunch spot. My personal favorite is their turkey sandwich...it's pretty ballet. Matt and Marie both work at the store, so definitely worth stopping by (if you like to support small businesses). Good vegetarian options ( if you're into that sort of thing) and nice, clean space to sit and eat (with some pretty cool looking tables). New spot that definitely had some love to into its conception and construction.
13128	64	5.0	-1	2014-07-07	Today myself and 2 of my friends went to Matt & Marie's for lunch.  The 3 sandwiches we ordered to share around was the Pastrami,  Capri, and Italian Stallion.  I cant say i favored one over the other because they were all equally excellent.  If you ordered any of these 3 you would be extremely happy.  A mere one bite into each sandwich allows you to taste the highest quality of ingredients along with a super fresh taste.  Its nice when a sandwich reflects all the love and care put it into it!
13129	64	5.0	-1	2014-07-02	Today I tried the Italian Stallion and the Uncle Gaetano.  Both were outstanding!!!   The Gaetano had a great balance of roasted turkey, pancetta, and garlic aioli.  The Italian Stallion is my favorite and is a must.  They had a perfect blend of fennel and genoa salami, topped with provolone cheese and pickled peppers, garnished with pepperoncini aioli.   The delicious taste truly reflects their care and high quality! Excellent!!!
13130	64	5.0	-1	2013-10-02	I was lucky enough to have lots of  Matt & Marie's during their menu-testing phase in New York this summer. The pastrami with pickles and aioil is TO DIE FOR. I cleaned a whole dish of it myself. And the homemade mozzarella was a dream. I can't wait to visit their Philly location!
13131	64	5.0	-1	2013-10-02	Had the privilege of eating these delicious sandwiches at a menu tasting in NYC and what a treat it was. From the carefully selected breads to the terrific combination of meats and other toppings it was pure perfection all around. My favorite was the broccoli rabe with goat cheese, and not being a lover of broccoli rabe, you know there was something special about it if now I crave it all the time. Would highly recommend to anyone I know. !!
13132	64	5.0	1	2015-01-10	I love this place!! Best sandwiches ever! I ordered the Italian stallion, which was amazing, and my husband got the Ducati Dealer, which is a aandwich like no other, and they were kind enough to fix my son a grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, which he loved. Everything came with a free side. Prices are very reasonable, decor is upscale and inviting, staff is friendly and accommodating, sandwiches are among the best I've ever had. Love supporting local business and budding entrepreneurs! Keep up the good work!
13133	64	5.0	1	2015-01-09	I just tried the Italian Stallion for the first time. It was incredible. The size of that sandwich was perfect, the bread is incredible (after all, how can you make a good sandwich with bad bread). I opted for oil and no mayo. The meat was of top quality and really delicious. I would highly recommend and encourage all to try a sandwich.
13134	64	5.0	1	2015-01-08	I absolutely LOVE Matt & Marie's. I've gone three times and each time it gets better. I have to say my favorite has been the meatball sandwich special. Bring back the meatballs. They were delicious and I can't wait to have them again.
13135	64	5.0	1	2015-01-07	Matt and Marie's is a great place to grab a bite to eat.  The first time I visited, I wasn't in the mood for a sandwich and ordered the Tuscan Bruschetta Salad. The salad was delicious and  big enough to serve as two meals.  The second time I visited, I ordered the Pieta Pastrami Sandwich, and I was happy to find that it was equally delicious.  I highly recommend Matt and Marie's to anyone looking for a good sandwich and salad.
13136	64	5.0	1	2015-01-06	Awesome sandwiches served quick and friendly.   Great fresh bread and ingredients.   Italian Stallion is my favorite
13137	64	1.0	1	2015-01-02	第一次来费城，看到评价很高就来了，结果。。。。发自内心的说一句，特别特别不适合中国人的口味，千万别来­吃啊！！！！面包硬的挑战你的口腔，各种奇怪的意式酱真的。。。总之，同行的朋友都没怎么吃！不过估计外国­人特别享受吧，他们应该很喜欢！
13138	64	1.0	1	2014-12-31	I just got swindled. No indication if they were open tonight and got charged for an order. Thinking about filing a police report for fraud. Stay away.
13139	64	5.0	1	2014-12-30	Love Matt & Maries and I have to say the American - Italian Hoagie is my favorite. Perfect combination of meats and it's a great value at $6.25. Super cute sandwich shop and I'm thrilled they are in the neighborhood. Look forward to trying some of the other sandwiches soon.
13140	64	4.0	1	2014-12-17	Just went there for a lunch date with my boyfriend and we both left very satisfied.  I got the falafel italiano and he got the italian stallion and the chicken noodle soup.  They offered sharp provolone in the soup, which was genius and delicious!  The owner was very friendly when she rang us up and she even took the time to walk around the eating area to see if everyone was enjoying their food.   I would definitely recommend and I will be going back!
13141	64	4.0	1	2014-12-11	This is a review update - but very strange that it appears my old review was removed. I'm happy to write a new review, but disappointed to see that the original one was taken down without any notice. Anyhow - When I first wrote about Matt & Marie's, I gave them 3 stars. At the time, there were only a few signature sandwiches available. I had found the bread to meat/toppings ratio to be too high, and the price point was pretty steep for a sandwich. ($9-$10 after tax.) Since then, I've had a few more sandwiches in my belly, and have been tempted to try their salads and soups. The new menu items offer good variety and can be ordered as a combo for a more reasonable price point for a Center City lunch. (Think options under $8.) Flavors are good, and the bread is really enjoyable. It makes the sandwich. Location is very clean, and service is friendly.
13142	64	3.0	1	2014-12-10	"So this place is in my office building, and I have to say that it is hit or miss. Yesterday I got the American Value Hoagie, and I was quite impressed for $6.25. The sandwich was large enough that I only ate half and have the other half for today's lunch. It was packed with ham, salami, capicola, lettuce, tomato, and onion. It was very tasty. The miss, however, is my coworker's meatball sandwich for $8.50. This is a this-week-only special, featuring housemade meatballs and sauce and mild provolone cheese on a roll. The problem with this sandwich is that the meatballs were tiny, more like Swedish meatball size, and the roll was enormous. He said the meatballs were, ""small, dry, and flavorless,"" and the sauce was ""mediocre."" He says, ""These balls were not touched by the hands of anyone who knows Italian cuisine."" The roll, however, was good. Previously, I had tried to get their hot roast beef sandwich while it was a special (before it was added to the regular menu), but they were already out of it at 12:30. The week before Thanksgiving, I got their Thanksgiving hoagie, with turkey, housemade sausage stuffing, and cranberries, which was very tasty. The issue with that, however, was that they seemed flummoxed by my request to have mayo on the roll as well, and it took a good 5 minutes to make. The place was empty, so it shouldn't have taken that long. Overall, this place is ok. They definitely need to work on their consistency, because when they are good, they're really good, but when they're bad, it's really bad. I would suggest focusing on making a product that is good every single time before expanding to other locations. There aren't many places for lunch if you work in Logan Square, so they could make a killing if they just concentrate."
13143	64	4.0	1	2014-12-09	For how much I didn't like the Roman Cavalry. the Pieta Pastrami I had today was amazing, the house made pickles and onions offered a nice balance. 2/3 isn't bad and I bought their Groupon so I will definitely be back for many more.
13144	64	5.0	1	2014-12-08	My friend and I stopped in today on a day trip to Philly.  We were greeted by a very friendly staff and we both ordered the special today which was a meatball sub.  It was amazing we could tell everything was made fresh and the potato salad was delicious as well.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for friendly quick affordable and delicious food
13145	64	5.0	1	2014-12-05	Amazing breakfast sandwiches and a great option for vegetarians! I go there as often as I can, and can't wait to hit it up again soonb:)
13146	64	4.0	1	2014-11-24	I was searching yelp today for lunch slots near my new office. I had planned to go elsewhere when the listing for this place caught my eye. I prefer hot lunch and this place seemed to only have cold sammies but the ones in the menu looked damn good so I called the audible and went here. I had planned to order some cavalry Sammie but went in and saw special with some kind of grilled chucked, fresh mozzarella and balsamic. Nuff said. The sandwhich was awesome and bursting with freshness. As a bonus they offered me a free skewer with melon and the best cured ham I have had in years. I will ask them about it next time and get it in a Sammie.
13147	64	5.0	1	2014-11-23	If you love a good sandwich then you will not be disappointed with this place. They're all about the proper rolls and fresh ingredients. The unique Ducati Dealer keeps me coming back. The owners are extremely friendly and you can tell they have a real passion for it.
13148	64	5.0	1	2014-11-21	Excellent food, clean dining area, and great customer service. Had a really nice simple dinner with my family. Matt helped make sure each of my four kids was happy! Very fast service too!
6784	64	4.0	1	2014-11-13	I am happy to see that another independently owned business has popped up in the neighborhood.  This married couple brings an inventive option to the Comcast-set and to Logan circle!  Thank goodness as it is nice to have an option that is not underneath the comcast tower and that is not a 7-11 or an Au Ban Pain.  The few times that I have been here the food has been delicious and the staff has been accommodating and friendly! I hope that this business is successful and will continue to frequent it when I have the opportunity.
13149	64	4.0	1	2014-11-11	I think you will struggle to find a sandwich place that will top this one, they have super fresh ingredients, their bread is legit, they have a good selection of toppings, and their staff is pretty awesome. We did the caprese, the hot pastrami, and the roast beef special. All were awesome and the prices were extremely reasonable especially for the roast beef and pastrami, they were huge. I will definitely be making the trek back here soon, I just wish they had one in Fishtown!
13150	64	5.0	1	2014-10-31	I had a yummy Italian sandwich at M&Ms. Philly is the city of hoagies and cheesesteaks, but Matt & Maries definitively shift the scene with their delicious Italian sandwiches. I had a eggplant mozza chicken combo and it was delicious. I also appreciated the free treat (it was Halloween week). The atmosphere was chill with not too loud music and warming colors. Finally, being greeted with a large smile is always a plus. Will definitively come back for more!
13151	64	5.0	1	2014-10-31	So went to Matt and Marie's for the first time today at a recommendation by a friend. Totally worth the time and parking cost. I was torn between the Nana's Tuna sandwich and the Peita Pastrami. Ended up going with the Peita Pastrami and didn't regret it. Potentially the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had. Sat down and ate it in house on the large table. Friendly staff. Also got the Capri sandwich for my wife.  If you're in the area and need something quickly, this is the place to go.
13152	64	4.0	1	2014-10-29	Oh the delicious artisan sandwiches! I've had the pleasure of dining at Matt and Marie's a few times now for lunch.  All of the sandwiches are pretty stellar with perfectly matched flavors.  You can tell they really put thought into creating the menu. But even so, I always seem to come back to my favorite, the Roman Calvary.  The coppa ham, mozzarella, the arugula, I just love all of the ingredients together.  And even better, the price is now $1 less.  The sandwiches also now come with free pasta salad, which was a bit heavy and rich for me but good to round out your lunch meal.
11527	64	5.0	1	2014-10-24	My favorite place to come for breakfast, lunch or light dinner. Awesome place, delicious sandwiches and terrific staff! Love it here!
7855	64	5.0	1	2014-10-22	"Lunch was so good here that I came back for dinner on the same day. It was the Verdura Double sandwich (Broccoli Rabe, goat cheese, garlic...) that made me wonder, ""are all their sandwiches this terrific?"" The answer to that question appears to be yes, judging by the Turkey and Cranberry Sauce sandwich I enjoyed later that evening. Marie, the owner, was kind enough to serve me this sandwich warmed up in the oven. She was as enthusiastic about making food as I was about eating her food. Thanks Marie for keeping me well-fed that day. And to the rest of you out there -- after enjoying a great lunch here, don't be too shy to come back for dinner."
13153	64	2.0	1	2014-10-22	Not sure how this place has a 4.5 star review. It was empty at lunch time -- a very awkward dining experience. Took them 5 minutes to find a plastic knife for my salad. Definitely nothing special about this place. I'd give them 3-6 months, depending on how deep daddy's checkbook is / how long the inheritance lasts before it runs out.
13154	64	5.0	1	2014-10-20	My coworkers and I stopped in for a quick lunch. I got the weekly special which was the Rosa; fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, housemade roasted peppers, and balsamic vinegar on fresh bread. I loved it. We all enjoyed our meals. I am planning to return to try some of their other sandwiches.
13155	64	3.0	1	2014-10-15	I guess I got the wrong thing. The chicken special was ok, but about 60% bread.  If I go back I'll stick to their recommendation of the Italian stallion or turkey.
13156	64	5.0	1	2014-10-09	We stumbled across this place using Yelp and were more than satisfied with our choice. These sandwiches are the best we have ever had! The turkey sandwich creation was one of the best mixes of flavors in each and every bite! I highly recommend!
13157	64	4.0	1	2014-10-06	The sandwiches here are great, I want to come back and try them all! Stopped by for lunch with coworkers and everyone loved it. The staff is also really friendly and welcoming - we will be back!
13158	64	5.0	1	2014-09-25	Great Italian bistro feel to this gem of a sandwich shop. Marie is a wonderful host with helpful hints as you peruse a tantalizing menu of favors she can put on a roll. A great place for lunch!
13159	64	4.0	1	2014-09-12	Came in for a sandwich for dinner. I ordered the Ducati (hot Italian sausage with carrots and stuff...I wish I remembered what the menu called it!). When I paid, I thought that 9.18 (8.50 plus tax) was a bit much for the 10-ish inch sandwich I was being handed...nonetheless, I took it and went outside to a nearby bench to eat and people-watch. The bread, fresh-baked by their baker, was delicious. The sausage was perfectly spicy. And the carrots and stuff added an interesting crunch as well as allayed some of the heat. Given that it's a small business (instead of neighboring cafe bohemoth Au Bon Pan) and they use fresh, quality ingredients, the price is worth it, I think!
13160	64	4.0	1	2014-09-03	Pros: The food is very tasty. I like the sandwiches offered, I'm sure they are all delicious. I don't mind paying a premium price for a nice offering and I'm happy I went. The uncle turkey whatever (play on turkey club) was awesome and I devoured it at my desk. Cons: 1. I don't need an education on what goes into a sandwich, I really don't care. It's unnecessary and awkward. I appreciate its fresh or chemical free, and what the purpose of each ingredient is, but it's just really weird to discuss with every customer. I trust that you know how to make a decent sandwich, you don't need to convince me further. 2. Have some more options, like salads and combos or deals and list information for what you do have. I would have gotten sides, but they asked me at the register when I was ready to pay. Idk what you have, how much they are, how much I get etc.  People like to know what all the options are before they are ready to leave,  aka a menu. List everything you sell on the board. It's not that difficult. I didn't want to get something tiny and get charged like $5 for it, which I figured could easily happen. (Looking at you Devon and Blakely) To the business owners: You have a great location, cute shop, and good food. The hard parts are accomplished, but you need to finish the idea. Add salads, some sort of combo deal and drop the sandwich education.
13161	64	4.0	1	2014-09-02	very good sandwiches, real roasted turkey... great work
13162	64	5.0	1	2014-08-28	Amazing sandwiches that fill you perfectly for lunch! Vegetarian friendly too! And Marie is always friendly and great!
13163	64	5.0	1	2014-08-19	Awesome sandwiches and always quick. The food quality is exceptional and the flavor is delicious. The neighborhood is great and needed this place. Love it!
6465	64	5.0	1	2014-08-16	This new spot is definitely worth checking out. The sandwiches were awesome and had great flavors. I saw some reviews that the sandwiches were over priced, but it's not fair to compare them to Wawa or other quick grab and go options. The ingredients were fresh and more in line with a Di Bruno offering than a convenience option. The shop is modern and clean, and the staff is friendly. I think I spoke to one of the owners and he was very warm and welcoming.
13164	64	5.0	1	2014-08-15	"This place is a top notch stand-out among the local Philly lunch options. The decor is upscale and inviting, with the menu written on butcher paper, and Frank Sinatra singing ""New York, New York."" I ordered the Italian Stallion, (because when in Rome...), and I was not at all disappointed. There was a lot of meat, the bread was soft but crunchy, and the peppers and onions gave the whole thing a nice kick. You could tell that all the ingredients are high-quality and fresh, and the cute owner, Marie, came around while I was eating to check how everything was. I also had a side of broccoli rabe, which was great. Before catching the train back to NYC, I stopped in again at 5:45pm and grabbed a sandwich for the way home, the Uncle Gaetano's Turkey this time, which has an amazing turkey (100% turkey and salt, nothing else added) with crispy pancetta, garlic aoili, and a tomato to lighten it up. If I worked in the area, I'd be here at least once a week. Loved the variety of beverage options. I had a Blood Orange San Pellegrino with my sandwich and an illy iced coffee to take with me for the road."
13165	64	4.0	1	2014-08-13	I love a good Italian sandwich so when I read the article on Philly.com I knew this was a place I wanted to try. I walk past it on my way to work and today was the day. I walked in to find a modern style deli counter with large paper rolls hanging on the wall with the menu written out. The menu was simple with about 8 sandwiches on it. The Capri caught my eye first since I love fresh mozzarella but after looking at all the choices I went with the Italian Stallion. All fresh Italian meats and cheeses including salami, coppa and sharp provolone served on a seeded Italian roll. The pepperoncini aioli was excellent with the right amount of spice.  It was the right balance of meat, cheese and bread. I will definitely be back to try the Capri and the Uncle G...roasted turkey with crispy pancetta? Yes, please!!
8375	64	4.0	1	2014-08-06	This place is in my building and my first experience was pre interview with my now job on the 6th floor. They have illy coffee which is basically a win in my book. While enjoying my java I noticed a few of the sandwiches listed on the menu came sans meat so I decided I would venture back down this way. Fast forward 3 weeks I'm in my new digs and was craving something between a roll . I wandered downstairs to see what if anything they had good and opted for one of the veggie sands without the tomatoes. The roll stood up nicely and have a sturdy base for the pretty decent size slices mozzarella, on the bread there was a delicious house made pesto and some roasted peppers. It was a very well made sandwich and I would probably order it again The reason for. 4 stars instead 5. The price point . In my mind a veggie sandwich should not be the exact same price as one with meats. I think if they knocked a dollar off if make Matt and Marie's a weekly venture I just can justify spending 9.14 weekly on cheese pesto , peppers and bread . I recently purchased a gilt deal for a lunch combos at Matt and Marie's so ill def be back . Apparently they have breakfast now some sort or savory bread pudding and a coffee for 4 bucks. This might be worth checking out .
13166	64	5.0	1	2014-08-04	Let me be the FIRST person to write a review about this wonderful new establishment. Delicious, creative, fresh sandwiches at a moderate price of $8.50 & 2 wonderful breakfast specials too for $4 each!  Where can you get that??  In the heart of Philly's financial district lies Matt & Marie's modern Italian sandwich shop. A wonderful new business & a great eatery. Big enough to bring all your friends &/ or family, yet small enough to be intimate. A great place for all the local business people to eat & they have catering available too!
13167	64	5.0	1	2014-08-04	Matt & Marie's is a great new lunch option in Center City.  The sandwiches are great, the staff is friendly and the store is clean and bright.  I would agree with a prior reviewer that the explanation of each ingredient as the sandwich is being made is a little over the top. However the thoughtful combinations, fresh ingredients and yummy bread are worth whatever explanation they want to give. I tried the Uncle Guy's Turkey (highly recommend) and my husband had the Italian Stallion. We were both very happy with our choices.  The sandwiches are deceivingly filling and absolutely worth the $8.50 price tag.   Can't wait to make it back to try some of the other offerings.
13168	64	2.0	1	2014-08-01	I went because I had a discount voucher (thank you, Gilt). Otherwise, i can't see that it's worth the trip. I tried to eat here once before with a co-worker, but she wanted a salad so we had to leave. I think a few more options would be a great idea - especially if you're catering to the lunch hours folks. Take a sandwich and be flexible enough to convert it into a small salad, for pete's sake. Also, my voucher entitled me to a side salad. There really weren't any of these in the fridge except for mozzarella and tomatoes, which were already in my sandwich. I opted for a tired-looking fruit salad. Note: bananas turn when they're cut so don't put them in a fruit salad that's going to be sitting around. Sandwich was good but there's so much competition around, I don't know why I'd bother going back.
10292	64	3.0	1	2014-08-01	I picked up a turkey sandwich here yesterday and it was so-so. Sure, the ingredients were fresh and the bread was enjoyable, but for $9, I felt a little silly. It's just a sandwich after all. They put a great emphasis on their ingredients, and even walked me through the steps of making the sandwich, one ingredient at a time, but...it's not rocket science. Plus, at this price, it would be tough to make this a regular lunch stop.
13169	64	3.0	1	2014-07-28	The sammies are Ok. There are only 7 so there is a limited variety. The service feels very forced. The try to over explain each sandwich while they make it. They act like their lunch meat is worthy of a story..darn annoying is what it is. Forget breakfast. They have some muffen with eggs in them. I got one with sausage..it was also a show, with the little muffin thing brought out from the back like it was the star of its own little show..and it did not taste good. So here is some free advice for the U of Penn owners. Focus on making good sandwiches, add a few special ones to add variety. And for petes sake, stop the song and dance around every order. Update...they have made some positive changes and even added some salads. I find myself going there more often.
13170	64	5.0	1	2014-07-24	If I want a cheap sandwich, I go to Wawa just down the street.  If I want a great sandwich where I don't have to worry about where the ingredients came from and where they've been sitting for how long, I go to Matt & Marie's.  Been there 3 times in 7 days.  Had 3 different sandwiches. All were fantastic!
13171	64	5.0	1	2014-07-23	Just had lunch here for the first time. Amazing sandwiches, great prices, friendly staff and fun atmosphere. All around great experience. Can't wait to come back!
13172	64	5.0	1	2014-07-18	The ingredients are so fresh! As a vegetarian, I love the capri. The other vegetarian sandwich, the verdura, is delicious but I'm personally not a big fan of smoky tastes.  Most of all, I love the little stuffed shooters you can buy on the side.  It is a pepper stuffed with herbed goat cheese...so tart and amazing.   I'm excited to see how this place progresses.  I hope they add a vegan option.
10199	64	3.0	1	2014-07-17	"This place has decent sandwiches but doesn't quite live up to its own hype. I've had two of their sandwiches:  (1) the Italian Stallion, which is similar to an Italian hoagie except instead of lettuce tomato and onions they give you a house made pepper relish. I was looking forward to the relish but I found it really didn't add much to the sandwich and I was missing the freshness of lettuce and tomatoes. The seeded roll was very good though.  (2) the Uncle Guys turkey sandwich is like a turkey club except pancetta instead of bacon an arugula instead of lettuce. I thought this one was better than the Italian. A couple things I don't like about this place. One is that there seems to be no option to vary the sandwich ingredients. The other is the way they ""narrate"" the building of the sandwich as you wait for it, which I think is unnecessary and a bit pretentious. The sandwiches here are not cheap so keep in mind that you will be paying $9 for just your sandwich which is a little pricey.   Overall, I wasn't blown away by Matt and Marie's, but if you work in the neighborhood it would be a decent option for a take out sandwich."
13173	64	5.0	1	2014-07-14	Their menu is great- no way to compare to them to hoagies from a convenience store. $9 is a bargain for quality ingredients, plus fast, custom service. Fresh bread, veggie and meat options, plus wonderful staff- recommend to anyone.
13174	64	5.0	1	2014-07-14	I had the pleasure of eating at Matt & Marie's last Wednesday while visiting Philly.  I go to Philly a good amount from NYC and always looking for a good lunch spot.  The place right away gives you an upscale sandwich shop feel. Super clean and crisp looking.  The staff was super friendly and inviting as you walk through the door.  They walked me through the options and I decided to go with the Uncle Guys' Turkey sandwich.  I love the personal touch they give you as they make your sandwich to tell you about the ingredients in the sandwich.  The price seems perfectly reasonable for such a high quality sandwich. I sat down at the communal table and inhaled my lunch.  I couldn't eat it fast enough, it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, I also bought some dark chocolate milano's that they sell at the cashier counter! A nice touch if you ask me! If I worked in the area I would see myself having lunch there most days.  Such a nice change from the usual sandwich shops.  The high quality of ingredients really makes a huge difference. I highly recommend everyone in the area to stop by and order up some deliciousness!
13175	64	5.0	1	2014-07-11	"I learned about Matt & Maries from a Tweet sent out by the Wharton School on Twitter. I was driving near 18th and Arch yesterday with my 15 year old daughter.  I asked her to run in to get us take out from Matt & Maries. She informed me upon re-entering the car, ""I got you the Italian Stallion"". Many years ago, as a college student I lived in Boston's North End (Italian section of Boston). I am spoiled by outstanding pizza and Italian sandwiches. Matt & Marie's sandwich gets a solid five enthusiastic stars from me. It was that good. I cannot comment on the ambiance of the store or anything else because I waited in the car (in a loading zone) while my daughter ran in. Bottom line: The sandwich was terrific. I will undoubtedly find a reason to detour through the Logan Circle area whenever I am in Philadelphia. It was worth it."
13176	64	3.0	1	2014-07-03	Great sandwich but like the others mentioned, $9 isn't really worth it especially with wawa 2 minutes away (at half the price) they do have illy coffee,  which is delicious if i want to grab a coffee in the am. plus i got a bit of a fancy pants attitude from marie. you're fine.
13177	64	2.0	1	2014-07-03	The sandwich was good, not bad not great.  My main problem here is the price, with tax I paid $9+ for a very small sandwich.  I like to support new independent places, unfortunately with the location and prices this place is going to be a hard sell for people.
13178	64	4.0	1	2014-07-02	4 stars for the atmosphere, cleanliness, customer service, the super sweet couple that runs the business and makes a genuine effort to get to know their customers. They changed up the menu so there is more variety, better pricing, healthy options etc. Bruschetta salad is fantastic. The tuna sandwich is made the way my dad does--traditional Italian style!
6896	64	5.0	1	2014-07-01	"This place is amazing. Food, service, speed, decor, everything. I'm not one to give out five star reviews lightly, but this place earned it 100%. I stopped in for coffee on my way to the office, and was pleasantly surprised that they serve illy (I don't know anywhere else nearby that does) and I grabbed one of the breakfast muffins to go as well, not because I was starving but because the sweet girl at the counter persuaded me. The breakfast muffin, they call it ""Al Forno"" is scrambled eggs, cheese, bread, and maybe a few other things, baked into a muffin. Incredible. Just the right amount of food for breakfast. I brought my co-workers back with me at lunch- I got the Uncle Guy's Turkey, with pancetta and garlic aoli, and I think a little lettuce. It was ""out of this world"" good. It was ""I'm going back tomorrow"" good. The bread is just the perfect texture- not too crunchy, not too soft. My one friend got the Italian Stallion, which she loved, and the other got the Pastrami, which he loved as well. One unique thing about this place is that as they're making the sandwiches, the people behind the counter tell you all about the ingredients- where they're from, how fresh they are, etc. Even though the line was long, the service was quick and friendly. Also, I got the pepper popper stuffed with goat cheese for a dollar. A-maz-ing. Just the right amount of kick. I really appreciate the drink selection, too. I had the Orange flavored Pellegrino, and it reminded me of my time in Florence. The whole experience did, really. So glad this place opened up, looking forward to my next visit (tomorrow!)"
13179	64	5.0	1	2014-07-01	I was visiting a friend and Philly and quickly decided to give this place a try. I used to live in the area and am always intrigued with the new places that open up. Personally, I LOVED the sandwich I had. I tried the Uncle Guy's Turkey and couldn't get enough. There was clearly alot of thought put into the combination of the ingredients and the quality of each one was 2nd to none.  At a high level, I just ordered a Turkey Club, but the fresh turkey, pancetta and homemade garlic aioli took it to another level. One of the best turkey sandwiches I've had - and I've had alot :).  The best part about it was that I didn't feel like a disgusting greaseball afterward. Fresh, simple, yet thoughtful. I liked it so much, I came back the next day before I got on the train to NYC and ordered another one. If I still lived in the area, this place would definitely be in my weekly lunch rotation. Stop in before the secret is out! I hope they open one up in NYC soon!
8637	64	3.0	1	2014-07-01	this place is clean, brand new, everyone is friendly, the food looks/tastes FRESH, and they are fast which is great for the lunch rush. they have a few signature sandwiches and while i wish there was a little bit more variety - it looks like they do a few things, but they do them very well. i ordered the vedura sandwich and omitted the goat cheese and substituted tomato slices.  the sandwich was great but i have to be honest the 9$ price tag for 3 ingredients hurt a little bit. i would say if you're not a vegan person, or if you are vegan but you're not attached to your $9 - this would be the place for you.
12043	64	5.0	1	2014-07-01	Ducati Dealer Sandwich - Hot Sausage mixed with english cucumbers and fresh ingredients.  It doesn't get any better.   This sandwich reminded me of the food down in Austin, TX.  The ingredients were top choice, fresh, and the flavors were well balance leaving me wanting more.  This shouldn't be placed in the same bucket and a basic hoagie and sandwich shop.  Matt & Marie's offers gourmet signature sandwiches that excite your taste buds. Pair all of this with a Mexican Coca-Cola made with Sugar Cane and you'll have self an excellent lunch!
13180	64	5.0	1	2014-07-01	I brought my team here for lunch today and everybody loved it! I got the turkey sandwich that was SO great.  The perfect ratio of meat to bread (I like meat!).  My team members are raving about the Italian Stallion and the Prosciutto sandwich.  Everybody was impressed by the home made, high quality meats and toppings.
13181	64	5.0	1	2014-06-26	Family and I ordered three different sandwiches today, and we all had the same reaction - wow!  Great place for lunch in Philly.  All three sandwiches were served on delicious Italian bread - perfectly fresh, soft to the bite, and well, amazing.  The Pieta Pastrami sandwich had a very generous portion of very lean pastrami combined with an interesting mix of dill pickles and onions.  I normally wouldn't order dill pickles, but I wanted to taste the sandwich as prepared, and I really liked it.  The Italian Stallion was very tasty - fresh, high quality, delicious meats and cheese.  Definitely worth ordering.  Uncle Guy's Turkey was absolutely delicious as well - Thanksgiving quality turkey  with a generous portion of pancetta, perfectly dressed with garlic aioli, tomato, and arugula,  The combination of flavors made this sandwich our favorite for the day!  The staff and owners were all friendly and helpful.  I can't wait to return - there are several other sandwich offerings I want to try out.
13182	64	5.0	1	2014-06-26	Awesome lunch option for Center City.  I've had a few of their sandwiches at this point and they're simply amazing.  Pick any of their sandwiches made from their great cuts of meat, fresh veggies, fantastic bread, and delicious cheeses and you won't go wrong...also, some great vegetarian options (I'm not one, but have tried one of their vegetarian sandwiches and it was the first time I've ever had a sandwich without meat and not thought something was missing).  Great ambiance and helpful staff, a definite new regular stop for workday lunches.
13183	64	4.0	1	2013-10-01	delicious! had their sandwiches at a catered lunch meeting. was fantastic - there was a selection of 4 different types of sandwiches, plus salad. first off, let me say that i *love* the bread that they are using - really the perfect consistency, didn't get soggy and held up well. i tried the turkey sandwich and the capri. both were delicious - capri has a roasted red pepper spread which was really really yummy. turkey had a special aioli, also delicious. the salad was so-so -- mostly a lack of salt in the vinaigrette, because the greens were great and it had nice slivers of cucumber. i gave feedback about the salad dressing and it was well received so i am sure it will be more flavorful in the future! looking forward to when they have a shop open!
13184	64	5.0	1	2013-09-30	I had Matt & Marie's for the first time last week for lunch at a conference.  Usually sandwiches for big groups are tasteless and lack variety.  Matt & Marie's sandwiches were delicious!  As a vegetarian, I loved the Capri but there were a ton of options!
13185	64	5.0	1	2013-09-29	Had these guys cater a golf event which went perfectly smoothly. The sandwiches were awesome holy moly! The Capri was cleaned out.
13186	65	5.0	-1	2012-07-11	Delicious food - especially the Greek dishes.  The Pork Tenderloin is a must try!  And the father and son owners are very charming.
13187	65	1.0	1	2014-11-29	My grandma spilled her hot coffee and when we told the waitress, she didn't do anything. We asked for water and ice to put on the burn and it took her minutes to get it for us. The restaurant is TINY; it shouldn't have taken more than a minute. The burn blistered and she has scabs all over her arm now. This was on top of below average food and terrible service in general. It took the waitress 10 minutes to even bring us menus and all of my food was overcooked.
13188	65	5.0	1	2014-07-24	I just ate here tonight. This is a small restaurant and bar inside the Days Inn. Who would have ever thought the Days Inn would have such a good restaurant. The food was awesome with big portions. We got complimentary warm bread that was right out of the oven with olive oil. Wings were slightly spicy and plump with a great taste. My tilapia came with a Greek salad which was decent. We enjoyed everything we ate including the house soup, tilapia special and Cajun chicken pasta. The food came out with perfect timing and our server was cool. She seemed very sencere. There aren't many food options in the area and this is probably the best bet.
13189	65	4.0	1	2014-06-22	This is not a location that I would normally be going to, but we did.  Very small inside, has a bar, and it's Greek.  So go with it.  One of us got the Lamb Chops with creamed spinach and fresh veggies.  All very good.  I got the Greek Pork Tenderloin with fresh veggies and fries.  All very good again.  Would visit again and try other Greek inspired dishes.
13190	65	4.0	1	2014-04-18	Went there last weekend. Had the best tilapia I've ever had, hands down! It was served in a white wine sauce with white grapes. Delicious and huge portions! My fiance got the chicken parm and he enjoyed his meal, too. Our waitress was attentive and sweet. Cute atmosphere, too. I would go back again.
13191	65	5.0	1	2014-03-21	Great food... Especially the lamb, which was phenomenal. Our server was the owner john and he knew every single one of the drinks I threw at him. Best restaurant attached to a hotel I've ever been too.
10720	65	3.0	1	2013-09-20	I saw some good reviews on YELP, and this place was so close to home I had to try. Now normally, I would have NEVER gotten out of my car when I saw it was attached to a Day's Inn, but I did. Normally I would have turned around when I walked into the dingy lobby, but I didn't. We walked through the bar area and were shown to a table. About 5-6 tables were occupied as well. Wait staff was pleasant. The menu had something for everyone, leaning toward Greek influence. We ordered a special app, was tasty, a ground beef with Mediterranean spices and pita points. Had the Greek salad, not the usual Greek salad preparation you are used to in New Jersey Diners, it was just OK , lettuce was a bit wilted. I prefer the standard preparation. Ordered the Lovers Nest  (for 2) lamb chops cooked to perfection, strip Steak, grilled shrimp. lobster tail, all done great, comes with 2 sides each, I had couscous and blue cheese creamed spinach, both good. The table also ordered Pork tenderloin, and Salmon - both to good reviews. So get past the location, get past the lobby and have a good meal. I was glad I did. Will return.
13192	65	4.0	1	2013-08-04	This restaurant was delightful. The service was great and the food was spectacular. I ordered the Basil's Mixed Grill w/New Zealand lamb chops were delicious, the steak was a generous portion cooked perfectly i had sweet potatoe fries were great. My husband ordered the lasagne which was the special and it too was delicious. We also had appetizers that were great. Overall is was a pleasant dining experience.
13193	65	4.0	1	2013-03-19	One of the best hotel restaurants I've been to. Mediterranean menu features a variety of pasta, meats and seafood dishes that are priced right. Just when you thought a hotel restaurant couldn't be good this one is outstanding
13194	65	5.0	1	2013-01-26	Went last night with another couple. We had the stuffed eggplant, scallops with bacon and mushrooms, calamari as apps and all were delicious!! I had the filet, my husband had the pork tenderloins and again it was fabulous. I can't believe we've lived so close for years and never been there before. The owners were great too, we definitely plan on being regular customers.
13195	65	1.0	1	2012-12-03	This place has awful service. We couldn't get seated for 15 minutes so we left. What a waste.
13196	65	4.0	1	2011-07-17	Perfectly cooked burger, excellent dressing for the Greek salad,small family run enviroment.
13197	66	1.0	-1	2014-08-13	compre una bandeja paisa hace unos 10 minutos, el chicharron y los maduros estan danados, el arroz y la carne estan duros la porcion da pena ya que para los $12 dolares que pague es una miseria, estoy muy descontenta. me parece una falta de respeto y un insulto que vendan comida danada y guardada. yo no quisiera rertarlo al departamento de salud pero tienen que ser mas consientes, si un cliente se enferma por su irresposabilidad de querer no mas hacer dinero y no pensar humana mente que pena me da que sean desconsiderados. yo hablare con el dueno y hare lo posible por reportar a mis conocidos y familiares que no visiten su restaurant.
13198	66	4.0	-1	2014-04-27	My wife and I are both of Eastern European descent. We enjoy variety and love to try different cuisines. Occasionally we feel the need for a latin food fix so with an Amazon local deal in hand, my wife and I decided to come here on a Thursday for a, post lunch rush, lunch and as it was the place was empty. Maybe the fact that the street outside was being re-paved kept the customers away. Sad because the food was very good if not excellent. We were greeted, seated and served by a fellow I suspect to be the owner. For starters we were offered a freshly made split pea soup which, my wife and I agreed, was to die for. Next my wife had the Salteado de Pollo, which is chicken sauteed with onions, peppers in a vodka like sauce, served with white rice topped with a  patacon(flattened and deep-fried plantain). I tasted a bite and we both thought it was delicious. Since I love seafood I ordered Cazuela de Mariscos, a seafood casserole with shrimp, calamari, fish, mussels, crab meat in a lite tomato sauce, also served with white rice and a patacon. This was very good but for the price I'd go with the Salteado de Pollo. I had a Sangria which was just barely OK, and my wife had coffee which is a freshly ground Colombian. The owner claims to import it from a specific growing region in the Colombian mountains that now I can not recall. The coffee was dynamite. There is a bakery next door associated with the restaurant that serves this coffee to go, and they have these melt in your mouth pastries filled with fruit that you absolutely have to try. The coffee is available for sale in 4 or 5 lbs bags unground for those so interested. Would certainly recommend for a casual date or couples night out. Nice, pleasant, well-mannered atmosphere.
13199	66	5.0	-1	2014-07-10	Cafe Colombia is my to go place for lunch everyday. The daily specials are out of this world especially the chicken or tilapia in lemon sauce. I have also tried the arepa with chorizo and they are very tasty. At the bakery, which is next door, you can get empanadas, pandebonos, arepas de chocolo and bread. Everything is very good and the owner, Don Hector, is so friendly and accommodating. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to try traditional Colombian food or just to have a great meal with family and friends.
13200	66	5.0	-1	2012-12-20	Hard to find ITALIAN food like Cafe Colombia Restaurant in Woodland Park offers. We thought, because the name , they only serves Colombian/International Food, but NOT; The Cheff is being cooking in Italian Restaurants for  years, and He really knows what to do in the Kitchen. Nothing to compare with other italian restaurants in the area. We recommend a 100% this restaurant......Amazing food and Service.
13201	66	3.0	1	2014-03-23	To start with... there is something of a language barrier, so it is very helpful if you can speak Spanish. Sadly I can't, so that made the communications a bit more difficult. Not impossible... just more difficult. The friendly waitress and owner were under the impression that Saturday was a 'holiday' and tried to refuse our LivingSocial coupon. We were able to convince him that Saturday is a weekend and not a holiday. The food was very good. I had the Bandeja Paisa while my wife had the Arepa Montañera.) We also had fried calamari which was good, but I have had better. We assumed that this was a BYO and I think that it SHOULD be because all they had was wine from NJ and that's the only kind of liquor they had. Plus, the NJ wines they did offer were pretty $teep. Every other restaurant we have been to, that has offered wine from NJ has always allowed customers to bring their own, but I couldn't get this across to the owner. I didn't want to argue, so we just ordered some sangria ($28) which was made from NJ wine I'm guessing and far from being good.   CC does offer a very distinctly different menu and I'd have no problem going back. However, I'd like to bring a Spanish speaking amigo with me to help with the language.
13202	66	4.0	1	2014-02-22	"Small TV...wine list .... next to bakery which has same name and is attached. $ I came here because we had an amazon voucher which was $20 for $40 worth of food. I'm glad we purchased that voucher since I love to support small businesses and I especially love to support my fellow COLOMBIANS. The place was empty when we got there, I was sad to see that because it is beautiful inside and the staff was so friendly. Their food was so good. We had choripapas as an appetizer, it was like having them in Colombia. I know that's hard to believe, but it's all in the ""chori"" of the Choripapas. It was a kind of sausage that I had in my choripapas the last time I was there last March, so I was very happy. I decided to try something typical as opposed to experimenting. I had an Arepa Montanera and my boyfriend had the most typical of all - Bandeja Paisa. The Arepa Montanera was amazing. The arepa was delicious. Many places make a crappy arepa, but this was like having one of my mom's areapas, and my mother's arepas are very good. When my mother is in colombia, my cousins wont' go buy arepas, because they want her arepas, so that's how good these arepas at cafe colombia were. Now this arepa montanera came with steak, chorizo and chicharron. The steak was okay, but the chorizo and chicharron were great. The chicharron especially was so crispy, which is essential in a good chicharron. It wasn't oily. It was perfect. The arepa montanera came with beans (red beans in case youre asking) they were so good. Best beans I've had in a restaurant. I'm kind of a red beans snob, I make good red beans, and my creator aka my mother makes amazing red beans, so it's hard to please me with your frijoles - but they did! I put it on my arepa. The only thing missing from the arepa was maybe a bit of butter or some cheese - you know something else to clog my arteries, but it was still very satisfying. My boyfriend's Bandeja Paisa was also very good, I pretty much had everything he had with  my arepa so I didnt' taste any of his with the exception of his rice, which was very good.  To wrap up we had Pan de Bonos which were okay, not the best, but okay. I'm sure it would be better if it were earlier in the d ay. The waiter which I think may have been part owner or family of owner was so nice. I would def. return and I hope that people in the area give this place a try. I hope they do well."
13203	414	1.0	-1	2013-11-01	I write this in hopes that this restaurant can be as great as it was the first time I visited. After our first dinner at The Pines, I would have given a 5 star rating but having been back for brunch (a 2 hr. ordeal in an emptyish dining room and having been served absolutely RAW sausage) and a subsequent dinner (again, over an hour wait for RAW meat and barely cooked pasta), I have to say I will not be coming back. I do not review often but the food here was so revolting and overpriced that I will be doing everything short of screaming from the mountaintops that this place should be avoided at all costs until major changes have been made.
13204	414	1.0	-1	2013-09-08	Pretentious service Uninspiring good Will never go  back....
13205	414	1.0	-1	2013-08-19	Wow. Do NOT believe their web site. The backyard had 1 dinner option and 3-4 sides. The most substantial menu item was stale tortillas wrapped around warmish pork and a few radish slices. That was the pig face taco. And it was the best of what we were served. Two of the other items on the backyard menu included grilled corn - served cold. And a burrata and watermelon salad that was tiny bits of the cheese (chewing gum size) sprinkled over a bunch of watermelon sitting in its own pink water. Wish we had done a U turn and gone to Littleneck next door.
13206	414	1.0	-1	2013-05-20	I wanted to like The Pines because of the concept, antique interior, and location, but the initial smell when walking into the restaurant should have been a sign that the experience would be bad.  The place smelled like a bathroom.  The restaurant is over priced.  I think we left the restaurant feeling like we had spent 100 alone on bread (because our entrees and share plates were so disappointing).  The drinks also could have been better.   The oxtail cappellacci was mediocre.  I know it gets many good reviews online (probably by reviewers who get comped meals) but anyone who I have talked to who has been there said they were also really disappointed.  We also had the wagyu culotte steak - this dish was incredibly disappointing.  In this case the rare steak was not done correctly and after sending it back to be cooked more it was actually edible.  I appreciate the effort to have the other featured ingredients with the steak but they didn't work (part of the reason I ordered the dish is I love mushrooms).   Our share plate was so forgettable and not very well put together.  I remember that the share plate had almost as much bread as the bread plate.  To be fair, I went here a few months ago but was really so disappointed with it. I heard through friends the only reason one would want to go is the backyard to drink but that the food is not worth your time and money.  The Pines is definitely overhyped and part of an overhyped wave of new overpriced restaurants taking over brooklyn, manhattan, etc. that we are force fed reviews by young freelancers who wil write a good review for anyone who comps them a meal.  For a regular person who has to pay for their own meal (or makes the mistake of going here on their birthday like I did) - I would highly suggest skipping it and going elsewhere.
13207	414	1.0	-1	2013-03-16	Don't go for dinner. If you must, go for drinks, sit at the bar and order two dishes with a friend to nibble on. Another reviewer here said that this place doesn't have a lot of edible food and he's totally right.
13208	414	1.0	-1	2013-01-28	I REALLY wanted to like this place, and while I do love the decor, everything else about the experience was pretty terrible. Our order was messed up (only 1 out of 3 dishes were right), and it was excruciatingly expensive for what was meh to downright bad food (what on earth is going on with that Testa dish?) in teeny-tiny portions. It's everything people hate about Brooklyn, down to the blaring ironic hip hop. We left the place feeling duped.
13209	414	2.0	-1	2012-10-14	Some friends and I went here for dinner last weekend, and had such a mediocre, overpriced experience I felt I had to write a (rare for me) yelp review.  I'm giving two stars instead of only one just because our cocktails were very good. We went to the pines feeling excited, ready to have a nice dinner, based on what we'd read online about the place. We were sadly disappointed. The charcuterie we ordered came with two tiny pieces of bread, a joke for the four people we had at the table, it would have been enough bread for a fifth of the meat on the plate. The duck leg we ordered was five bites, not even a half of an actual duck leg, just peices strewn around the plate. Very small portions, and even though we expected that, and ordered six plates for the four of us, we were all hungry, and upset about the money and time we invested in the dinner when we left. Nothing we ate was especially good, our dishes varied from 'not bad' to 'actively gross'.  Not recommended at all.
13210	414	3.0	-1	2012-09-19	Food: 3.5 Atmosphere: 4 Service: 4 Overall: between a 3 and 4; they've just opened and are probably still working out the kinks.   The food was good, not great and a little expensive for what was served.  That being said, my friend and I thought that the short ribs and pork chops dishes (about $30, each) were worth trying again. They have a very good selection of draft beers, including Gaffel Kölsch (a major, major plus).   I like the rustic decor and the staff was friendly.   I'll probably eat here again.
13211	414	4.0	-1	2014-04-05	Great food and service is very nice.  Different and delicious!   Only thing is that they play only 90's music.  They need to mix it up!
13212	414	5.0	-1	2014-12-06	Amazing food and atmosphere! First of all, I love the interior and decoration of the Pines. The beautiful paintings of the staff gives the space a personal touch. Everything is well put together and makes me feel very comfortable. The bread was the best I've ever had! They had different kinds of rustic bread with amazing homemade butter (I could eat that everyday!) The restaurant uses local and seasonal products, so everything was super fresh and tasty. I ordered some grilled lettuce with nasturtium, with an wonderful dressing. I had a great combination of soft, crispy and crunchy. The agnolotti was cooked to perfection. Divine! The pasta was the most all dente I've ever tasted and the stuffing was rich of flavor. For dessert I had a chocolate cake, one of the best! It was still a bit soft and had a rich texture. Every dish had a perfect portion and I didn't feel stuffed at all. The wine pairing is definitely a recommendation! They have beautiful biological wines that go perfect with the meals. The restaurant manager (I think his name was Anthony) was great! Super friendly and hospitable. He explained every dish to us and our waters were filled when they were empty. To be short: go to the Pines because it is an AMAZING place.
13213	414	5.0	-1	2014-03-26	Sometimes you never want to leave your neighborhood to eat, but this is totally worth it. The wine, the food, everything is great. The wine is really unexpected and distinct. The baked clams are off the hook.
13214	414	5.0	-1	2014-02-05	The Pines combines a sweet and relaxed atmosphere (ask for the story behind the decor, very cool) with just insanely delicious food and really great service. The menu is interesting and features flavor combinations that are innovative and seemingly brand new, but obviously carefully tested. The food is seriously scrumptious, as are the cocktails. And The Pines lacks the pretense of some innovative Brooklyn restaurants-they make their guests feel very welcome and providing them with an enjoyable culinary experience is clearly top priority. Go back a lot because the menu changes all the time, and try an Uncle Buck!
13215	414	5.0	-1	2014-01-28	I've been to The Pines a few times and it's always been great. The food is outstanding and so creative. The staff are super friendly and nice and can answer any questions you have about the menus. The bar is a nice spot to sit and eat or get a drink. The atmosphere is chill and casual and the decor is perfectly Brooklyn. I love that you can see the kitchen. I would definitely recommend!
13216	414	5.0	-1	2014-01-24	This place is a one of a kind! I have been there over and over again and never had less than a great experience. The food is unique and delicious with playful twists that keep you coming back for more. And the drinks are awesome. All of the staff, front of the house and back are extremely friendly and personable. I recommend going with friends, sharing as many dishes as you can fit in your belly and then hanging out in the backyard by the fire. They have s'mores! I highly recommend this spot for a nice date or a great night out with friends.
13217	414	5.0	-1	2014-01-22	"I have been here at least half a dozen times, however never for brunch, the menu changes quite often which is great because i tend to get stuck in routine at my favorite restaurants.  Anyway I especially enjoyed the 2 rabbit dishes, i've never had rabbit before and I was pleasantly surprised!  When i can swing it I always get the Wag-yu steak, they have some secrete way of cooking it that the chef tried to explain to me but I'm no foodie so i cant tell you what it was.  The ""Ants on a log"" desert is probably my favorite of all time, its just so friggin clever!  The rest of the menu is really creative and fun and I have never been totally disappointed in anything i ordered, I would always recommend the salumi plate for starters! I think the food is quite unique even for brooklyn, and the booze selection is quite good (I don't drink wine!).  DON'T TELL ANYONE! but sometimes on the weekends they have a free DIY S'mores bar by the fire pit in the back yard, hardly anyone ever ventures back there, but its a super sweet treat to end any meal! especially if anyone in your group smokes...lol.  My only gripe about this place is that they don't have a burger on the menu, ever! and I'm pretty sure they take credit cards now."
13218	414	5.0	-1	2013-09-15	We absolutely love the Pines. Having eaten here numerous times, the food, the service, the whole experience has never failed to amaze. The mixed reviews on here are so baffling and inspired me to chime in. We are luck to have a place of this caliber in our neighborhood.
13219	414	5.0	-1	2013-06-03	I've eaten at The Pines several times and it keeps getting better and better. I gave a four star review very soon after they opened citing focus and service as two things that prevented me from giving five stars, which I do not do lightly. At this point, Angelo has really hit his stride. His food is so creative, inspired and downright delicious that I believe he will be recognized as a truly great chef. All of the kinks have been ironed out on the service and, now with the back yard in full swing, I'd give six stars if I could.
13220	414	5.0	-1	2013-05-29	The day after writing my review, I received a very thoughtful call from the restaurant owner who explained that the restaurant is pretty new and that they are working out the kinks involved in serving large parties (There were 8 of us).  He took my comments  seriously, invited me back, and provided an accomodation for the problems we encountered.  I have never received better customer service from a complaint.   Hopefully my situation was a one-time  glitch and that most people will have a better experience.   My customer service experience was 5 star.
13221	414	5.0	-1	2013-05-24	I finally brought my brother to a restaurant that he loved! Everything we ordered was on point. It was so obvious the care that was put into each dish. The octopus was a stand out, and may have been one of the best I've ever had. It was totally packed, but they still managed to seat us within 15. As a person who works in the industry, I understand how hard it is to make everyone happy when you have a small space, and people all coming in at the same time. Be patient fellow customers, it's worth it, and everyone there was doing the best they could. I would recommend The Pines to everyone!
13222	414	5.0	-1	2013-04-15	"I really don't get the negative reviews for this restaurant other than I am always suspicious of the anonymity of these forums and the agendas that some must have. I always laugh at the self promoting intros of these negative reviews as if it establishes their bona fide culinary credentials ""I am a foodie that has eaten at many high end restaurants....."" blah blah blah. Anyway, I have been to the pines twice and both times I thought it was spectacular. Every aspect of the meal, the bread, appetizers, pastas and entrees were superb and the service was terrific. They take reservations, which is a welcome relief in Brooklyn these days. Waiting outside by the outdoor fire for a drink is not a bad way to go however if you are game to wait for a walk-in rez."
13223	414	5.0	-1	2013-03-26	The Pines is killer! Gowanus is on fire (not the canal, although you could probably set fire to the canal) Completely worth the walk across the lovely canal.
13224	414	5.0	-1	2013-03-24	Our evening at the Pines surprised us at every turn and left with us at the end of the evening mulling over one of the best restaurant experiences we have had in ages. The space was warm and inviting , the buzz of excited and enthusiastic diners coupled with the warmth of the rustic interior made us feel at home as soon as we entered. There was a brief wait for a table but we were invited to wait in their large back yard where a campfire was blazing and surrounded by other patrons, chatting and roasting marshmallows. We struck up a few conversations while we waited snugly round the fire until our table was ready. We were guided through the menu by our delightful server who had a fantastic knowledge of al the items and also the wines. She helped us select a great bottle. Simply worded on the menu but complex and intriguing combinations for each course  that was presented. The bread and cheese plate with a local brie and a simple farm cheese went so well with the (pickled?)strawberries that accompanied them. Pears slathered in goats milk yoghurt and sesame seeds were actually one of the highlights of the meal. The testa was amazing, apparently house made and one of the best I have ever had, served with warm pumpkin bread. The cappellacci was my favorite of the night, stuffed with oxtail and heaped with shaved black truffles, it was amazing. We tried half of the menu and are already planning our return to try the rest. The must haves so far are the testa, the cappellacci and the duck breast-but judging from what we did have the dishes left to try will be amazing as well.
13225	414	5.0	-1	2013-03-12	The Pines is among the best restaurants I have been to in a long while. The dishes and flavor combinations are unique and creative. Even when they missed for me on a personal level I could see the intent to push the envelope and create new and exciting flavors. I have not written a Yelp review before and was inspired to sing the prices of the Pines after my recent meal there. Everyone should try this place , it is something special.
13226	414	5.0	-1	2013-03-01	I've been hearing more and more about the Pines, so I decided to go check it out. It was definitely worth it. I was greeted with great service and amazing food. The apples in sheepsmilk yogurt was very delicious, crisp, and refreshing. The sweet potato with buttermilk and pistachio was so delicious i almost ordered seconds. My entree, the steak, seemed a bit scary at first because of how red it looked, but it wasn't raw or undercooked at all, but was actually cooked to perfection. The dessert was what really blew me away. It was a a unique take on ants on a log with a celery granita, peanut butter powder, and brandied raisins. Overall, a fantastic meal, helpful and kind service, and a great environment. I urge everyone to go, you definitely won't regret it.
13227	414	5.0	-1	2013-01-29	"To quote a friend ""I had the bread for dessert"".  Is it the bread or the caraway butter that is so fantastic?  No idea and who cares.  It is amazing!   Worth the visit just for that!!!     My dinner that night?  The hand rolled pici pasta. Fantastic!!!! Took my kids there for brunch one day. I skipped the bread & pasta this time and went for the poached eggs and hen of the woods mushrooms.  I ate every last bite.  And followed it up with a side of mouth watering yummy cinnamon toast.   My kids had the cured bacon and waffles and could not have been happier. Can't wait for the backyard to open up for outdoor dining this Spring and Summer!!!"
12286	414	5.0	-1	2013-01-26	Love The Pines. It was truly a magical experience. The space is great, the food is amazing and the staff is lovely. That was a meal I will remember for a long time. At first glance the dishes seemed simple but revealed their complexity and the thoughtfulness with each bite. Kudos, cant wait to come back.
13228	414	5.0	-1	2013-01-16	After two visits, I am in love with this place - the food, the ambiance, the soundtrack - it all comes together for a memorable meal.   Somebody here cares about food and the experience of those eating his or her food.  Actually, it seems everyone that works there, cares about the details and your experience.  This restaurant is everything that is right with the Brooklyn dining scene - but don't even categorize it as that - just a wonderful restaurant that you will want to go back to and keep trying.  The bone marrow is so simple, beautiful and delicious, I crave the pasta with duck and I had a tripe dish last night that tasted like home (I'm 1st generation Italian - and I do NOT call sauce GRAVY).   This is not a place for big groups - so don't go with 5 of your friends - keep it simple, like they do and you will have a great experience.
13229	414	5.0	-1	2012-12-26	Simple creative food.  Good service and pleasant environment. One of the most exciting places to eat in New York.
13230	414	5.0	-1	2012-12-19	"The Pines is ""tres Brooklyn,"" as the French supposedly say. The decor is carefully worsted, the ambience is relaxed, the crowd is wearing a lot of plaid, and the food is adventurous but simple. I've been here a few times now, and the menu changes, but some excellent dishes to look out for are the prosciuotto (with amazing sesame bread), the apples (slathered in sheep's milk and honey), the sweet potato (with buttermilk and sardine stuffed inside like little sandwiches), the pici pasta (with trotter) and the wagyu steak (which comes in lots of small pieces and is surprisingly light). Ingredients all seem like they're well-sourced and very fresh. In general, the food strikes a balance between approachability (there's nothing ""weird"" here) and experimentalism (but there are lots of flavor surprises). Cocktails are also very good (on par with any mixologist-type place you might care to name) and the wine list is really interesting--I was not familiar with most of the names, but everything I've tried has been funky in a good way. Service is very friendly and relaxed; there's a very nice manager lady who's looked out for me when I've visited. In sum: This is a very laid-back, friendly spot with pretty ambitious food that can take its place with the better Brooklyn restaurants that have opened in the last few years. Unless you're some kind of bitter hater like the guy Dimitri K. below who gave it one star, you'll probably have a good time."
13231	414	5.0	-1	2012-11-29	Coming into a new restaurant with high expectations can go one of two ways.  In the case of The Pines, I was blown away.   We had a fairly large group so I was lucky enough to taste just about every item on the menu.  All of the dishes maintain this balance between simple and complex.  It's obvious the Chef is passionate about food and lets his ingredients speak for themselves.   Definitely one of my most memorable dining experiences of 2012...The smoked cocktails helped.
13232	414	5.0	-1	2012-11-17	"I was impressed by the earthy, funky sulfite free wine selection, uniquely curated. The cocktails are impressive and culinary. I had the Baked Apple and it is worth all the praise it has received, but have to say The Pines drink is particularly refreshing and drinkable, delicious. We started with the testa, wow. The combination of the thinly sliced testa with the slightly sweet pumpkin bread was perfect, then a few bites of celtuse to give a bit of crunch. Inspired, unique. ""When have I ever seen or ever dreamt of this? but how have I lived without it until now?"" This is what I have to say about everything I had at The Pines. When I think of jicama, I think of the dried out sticks they serve at some salad bars, this was fresh and the consistency was more like water chestnuts. With coconut and pancetta, the combination was a perfect appetizer. I had oxtail cappellacci in crab brodo, sort of an italian ""soup dumpling"". The broth is so good you want to drink it in a mug. We  also had the madai crudo, I had never had this fish but it's now a favorite. It was tender, light, yet buttery. I appreciated the crispy skin left on. I shared the pork shoulder, good choice, it's actually a very generous portion. Tender, perfectly seasoned. My overall impression is that this is NOT a chef asleep at the wheel. There is a sense of play, a passionate interest in great food. I definitely will be back soon."
13233	414	5.0	-1	2012-09-27	"Had the absolute best experience last evening, thanks to Chef Angelo and his wonderfully attentive and gracious staff.  Loved the tomato mustarda; cheese & breads .....delicious!!  The homemade cavatelli w/trotter ragu....loved, loved, loved!  Had a sampling of almost all of the menu items (way too full to eat another morsel), and today I was thinking that I should have went the distance right on through to dessert!  The decor is cozy, warm, inviting and comfortable. Love the distressed feel to the place, and the outside garden really completes the ambience of The Pines. It was a full house last night and what I observed & heard were the sounds of ""ums and ahhs"", which of course = so delicious!  The Pines is a keeper; Chef Angelo is a treasure, and everyone near and far should pay this place a visit!  I know that I'll be back!"
13234	414	5.0	1	2014-12-15	Delicious food. Got there 10 or so minutes late for our reservation, and had to wait at the back. The manager kept coming by to talk to us, and made us feel very welcome. It Made the wait go by very fast. Service was fantastic!
13235	414	5.0	1	2014-12-07	"This is such a special and wonderful place; I hope the folks of Park Slope and Brooklyn will show strong support for this creative and unique establishment to make it a fixture in the neighborhood for years to come.  The owner has managed to combine an inventive menu, filled with items you would never venture to prepare at home, with a casual, homey, neighborhood atmosphere, without pretense or attitude.  There is simply no comparison in the Slope, Cobble Hill, Bklyn Hts. region - none. There were four of us in our party, which is a minimum to experience the full range of the menu.  Our server had complete knowledge of the menu, and the hard cider list, and guided us toward perfection - trust your server!  They are well versed in the ingredients and the best way to enjoy your evening.  There's no need to plan an event after your meal - this place is the event - linger and enjoy it. The four of us ordered all different appetizers and entrees and there were only a couple of items on the menu we didn't end up trying - a reason to return!  The items came out as they were ready, and we shared and enjoyed each one together.  Since the menu is changed frequently, I won't describe each item, lest you become disappointed at its absence.  Suffice it to say that you cannot go wrong.  I was disappointed when my husband ordered what I thought to be one of the more simple and unexciting items listed, but then was over the moon once it arrived - a simple pasta with eggplant dish was unlike anything I had ever eaten, and one of my favorites of the night.  We went for our ""Sunday night supper"" and so we wanted cider and beer instead of the wine, but we have visited before for drinks at the bar and the wine list is perfectly matched in variety and approachability.   I can't wait to return.  Why in the world do places like Talde get all of the attention when this gem far surpasses any celebrity chef restaurant in our dining mecca of a borough.  Thank you Pines!!!"
13236	414	5.0	1	2014-12-03	RUN, DONT WALK. Such a special place. Service and creativity are on point. Rivals any well-known New American restaurant in Manhattan. Menu is curated to include 3-4 in each category, but nothing disappoints. Please start serving weekend brunch!!
13237	414	5.0	1	2014-11-29	The menu was farm-to table based with simple descriptions that were expanded upon by our lovely server. The dishes however blew us away! Delicate and modern, extremely well balanced, beautifully presented and totally delicious. A true diamond in the rough,
13238	414	4.0	1	2014-11-19	I want to love Gowanus and the Pines certainly helps in that endeavor.  3 of us came here for dinner--well, one of us was preggers so technically it was 4 of us--and the ambiance/vibe is super cute.  Cocktails were tasty. Service was great too. Get the Bread.  It's weird I know to order bread but it was really really tasty.  (Shout out to Runner & Stone!) The vegetable dishes (we ordered two) were good but not that memorable unfortunately.  The pasta was AMAZING.  We shared the steak (you order by weight to determine how big of a cut you get) which was good but a little on the fibrous side.  It came with these tasty pierogis with some crazy osso bucco/oxtail filling.   Overall a good meal but I think this is one of those places where you really need to know what to order to make it a 5 star spot.
13239	414	5.0	1	2014-11-12	Very hospitable place. Food is interesting and well prepared. One of the best of the Park Slope restaurants. A tad on the expensive side.
13240	414	3.0	1	2014-11-10	I went back to the Pines with my friend Saturday night to give it another try. We started out with the bread basket that had eluded me on my previous visit, and it was absolutely delicious! Baked across the street by Runner and Stone, the bread was among the best that I have ever had, and was accompanied by a slab of delectable homemade butter, compliments of The Pines itself. We then continued with shares of the squid and the scallops. The seafood was just average, and while the overall dishes were tasty, both were served lukewarm. However, the turnip whip, topped with mint oil and served at the beginning of the meal, was palatable and refreshing. Also, the service was both friendly and helpful this time around, and we were able to take our time ordering. And, choosing to sit at the bar again, this lent itself to a very laid back experience.
13241	414	5.0	1	2014-10-28	That's right; 5 stars! I offer up these five fat stars for several reasons: 1 - Creativity 2 - Execution 3 - Service 4 - Ambience/Vibe This restaurant is taking major chances with its food and it pays off. I went several times when they first opened and loved it, though the food could be reaching perhaps a bit too far on occasion. These days it seems as adventurous but the dishes are bolted-down tight before they make the menu. I love the vibe both at the bar and table where I've encountered only warm and attentive service. Questions were answered thoroughly with regards to ingredients and drink pairings, as well as how much food to get for the group. They also take credit cards now which is fantastic. Now that there are a couple of additional spots in the area such as the Royal Palms and Lavender Lake it's easier to make it a part of your night as opposed to a destination (not that there's anything wrong with Canal Bar!). Great job Pines! I'll be back soon.
13242	414	3.0	1	2014-10-27	"i've had this place on my ""list"" for some time,but took a while before I could get a rez. Restaurant is cozy and staff was really nice. I had a good salad and the tilefish, both of which I thought were tasty. Bread basket was ample,though that is an extra cost. 2 people at my table shared the special- a very expensive steak which they both sadly really disliked- bad cut of beef apparently. all in all experience was okay, though somewhat disappointing:(. Would not discourage a visit, but not sure I'd actually reocommend."
13243	414	4.0	1	2014-10-22	"Food-wise, quite possibly the best restaurant meal I've had all year.  Stupid good.  Each dish left us speechless, and we had a lot of dishes.  Ambience is very much Brooklyn-hipster-divey: there was an ""interesting"" aroma of stripped-to-the-lathe old structure that was noticeable, not necessarily bad, but might be reconsidered...  Service was agreeable  if a little slow and inattentive: we frequently had to go out of our way to wave down a server.  Those are minor quibbles.  I would run back here in a heartbeat."
13244	414	5.0	1	2014-10-22	So, I decided to give The Pines another chance. The owner had kindly written to me after my first unfavorable review and invited me to return and give them a second chance. I am very glad I did. On this Sunday night, the ambiance was both relaxing and welcoming. The grating music of my previous visit was gone, replaced by a pleasant soundtrack of eclectic music that did not compete with the dining experience. My daughter and I shared a warm cabbage salad to start, which was astringent and delicious. She ordered the duck breast, crisp and succulent, and I had the pasta with lemon and mushrooms, light and flavorful. For dessert we shared a platter of soft cheeses. We took our time and never felt rushed, though the restaurant did fill up. Our waiter was very attentive but not overbearing. This experience was a complete correction to my first unpleasant visit. They are a wonderful addition to the Brooklyn dining scene.
13245	414	4.0	1	2014-10-17	Had a really good meal with my parents here tonight. Service was all very polite and casual and accommodating. My folks don't eat mammals and I have lots of dietary restrictions, and these limits were welcomed easily and accounted for readily. We started with an amuse of whipped carrot soup with mint oil that had us all scraping our tiny glasses for the last smear. This was followed by the bread and cultured butter--this bread was so good, crackly, earthy, delicious, and drizzled with olive oil and sea salt, even more delicious. We ordered the cabbage, boar belly on the side, which was also really good if maybe a bit too salty; both pastas, one an inky round noodle with eggplant and a creamy tomato sauce, very good, and the borsa vuota with maitake mushrooms and spinach dressed with lemon and ground chestnut, which was subtle and perfect with really excellent texture. Then a much-needed pause happened, and after about 10 minutes, we were served the tilefish in broth with julienned zucchini, really very tasty, and the duck breast with brussels sprouts, sweet potato and peanut. The duck was really well cooked, crispy and chewy, and the plate was full of flavor, though again, maybe too salty. Maybe the saltedness really came along with the meat--and maybe in part because I'm not really a meat lover, I felt like the two dishes with meat in them were the least compelling, really just showcases for salt and fat (though we still cleaned those plates!). We could have had no meat at all--not even the fish, though it was good--and probably had a perfect meal. We were pretty delighted to be delivered a post-meal gastrique of fennel and ginger, which was not too sweet and tasted like a really healthful digestif. We capped the night with the lemon steamed pudding with fennel (two kinds--maybe poached and sugared/dehydrated?) and black pepper on top of a bruleed smear of meringue, drizzled with fennel seeds. Definitely not a combo I would have assembled myself, and a really great one. This meal was expensive, which is why I saved it for an occasion where my parents were paying. For three of us ordering six dishes plus dessert and a drink apiece, we made it to $200. It was great to be treated to that--my parents only come to town every couple of years--and the food was really tasty and inventive. This is definitely a special occasion-type place for me, though. For a cheaper and more casual but still very tasty meal, I'd probably head next door to Littleneck.
13246	414	4.0	1	2014-10-13	I had been wanting to check out The Pines for quite some time and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience there. I would recommend it to all my friends, and I plan on going back with my friends who I know will love this place as well. A bit of a trek for me, going all the way down to Gowanus, but definitely worth it. Some of the food was borderline too salty, but it didn't numb my tongue, and the food was extremely flavorful (a lot of umami), so I think it would be fine for the average American. I'm a little sensitive to salt. They have a great beverage program- you can tell that it's thoughtful, and the wine list is very easy to navigate as the grape varietal names are on the first line. We had a bottle of Lambrusco, which was amazing! A much drier and funkier Lambrusco than others that I've tried before. The staff were very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the beverage selections. We ordered the squid, duck rillette, beef tartare, cabbage with boar belly, grouper with tomato dashi, beef chuck steak and black trumpet mushroom pasta with lamb belly bacon. My absolute favorite was the chuck steak. Such great flavor in the meat!!! And amazing texture. The lamb belly in the pasta was one of my favorites too. The food was some of the best I've had in a while in NYC and the service was spot on. They were personable but also knowledgeable about the way the food was cooked. There is a sense of passion and enthusiasm that you don't find in many restaurants here. Can't wait to go back and try their other dishes!
13247	414	4.0	1	2014-10-13	My husband I had a wonderful meal here.  First of all, unlike most Brooklyn restaurants, they take reservations. (We are so tired of trying to go out only to be told there is a 60-90 minute wait.) The service was very attentive and warm, without being stuffy or obtrusive. And the food! We ordered the cabbage with miatake mushrooms and boar belly bacon, the borsa vuota with chestnuts, spinach and mushrooms, the chuck steak with chanterelles,  and the chocolate cake. Everything was delicious and special. We really felt there were some unique flavors happening, without any weirdness for its own sake. They also brought out an amuse bouche of whipped fennel with mint oil. I love going to a restaurant and getting this kind of bonus taste. Plus I could have eaten a giant bowl of it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the music. While I like going out and dancing to bass thumping hip hop and is punk definitely on my running playlist, it's not what I want at dinner. I'm am not suggesting they should be playing chamber music, but something more chill would be an improvement.
13248	414	5.0	1	2014-10-06	It is not an exaggeration--I love absolutely everything about this place.  Wine list (including by the glass) is unreal, never had a morsel that didn't rock my world, perfect music and atmosphere, perfect service, perfect location.  They don't rest on their laurels.  I've been here about 10 times now and always had the chance to try incredible specials and never had a dip in quality.  Can't recommend highly enough.
13249	414	5.0	1	2014-10-01	Seriously great food here served by very nice and informative wait staff (owners?) who obviously take pride in everything they do - from mixing the perfect Martini to keeping the water glasses filled with infused water. Had no trouble getting in on Tuesday night and the music was fun and not too loud. Shared two outstanding starters - a squash puree with amazing grilled radicchio and a cabbage dish whose complexity rolled out from first bite to finish. The two pastas of the day were more exciting and inventive than anything we had in Rome last week. Off the beaten trail for us, but plan to make it out there again soon.
13250	414	3.0	1	2014-08-28	Updating for customer service, thanks to Carver for reaching out!!
13251	414	5.0	1	2014-08-11	The Pines has become my favorite restaurant in all of NYC. The food is extremely inventive, with unexpected pairings of ingredients and flavors (foie gras with rhubarb is a particular fave), and it always works. The service is excellent, the cocktails delicious, the atmosphere cozy. I've eaten there maybe 8 or 10 times at this point and it is fabulous every time. I have never had a dish there that was not wonderful. I cannot recommend this place highly enough!
13252	414	5.0	1	2014-07-30	I cannot believe I got a reservation the day of to this place. High end experimental cuisine that tastes AMAZING for a reasonable price. Leaves you pining for more. Pun intended, the food is just THAT good.
13253	414	4.0	1	2014-07-27	Expensive but delicious. Best enjoyed with adventurous eaters.  We shared 5 plates among four of us - everything was terrific, made with unusual ingredients but bursting with flavor. Wines in particular seemed super expensive - we ordered a bottle of the cheapest red and it was really excellent. Desserts were underwhelming - not sweet enough.
13254	414	5.0	1	2014-07-26	We absolutely loved our meal.  We traveled from Manhattan and thought it was definitely worth the trip.  While its not cheap, we thought the food lived up to its price.  Highlights were the snap peas, agnolotti, black bass and bread.  Not one dish disappointed.  We will be back.
13255	414	5.0	1	2014-07-18	holy cow this place was delicious! came for my birthday with a few friends.  had some fun cocktails and we split a bunch of plates (which they recommend) - the squid, snap peas, string beans, agnoletti and bass.  all were amazing - beautifully prepared, fantastic flavors.  in the end, we had some delicious sauces left over so we ordered the bread to sop up all the remaining goodness - so I'd recommend doing this earlier!
13256	414	5.0	1	2014-07-09	I just heard that the chef left.  If you've been there since he left, what do you think?  Is it still wonderful?
13257	414	4.0	1	2014-07-02	Came here for a birthday dinner and the place was so cute and quaint! Excellent dishes, I tried about ten different ones and the Borsa Vuota was by far my favorite. The Good: - Borsa Vuota--MUST GET. Al dente pasta in a browned butter sauce. I could eat ten bowls of this and DID NOT want to share. - Bread w/whipped butter--Buckwheat, sourdough and sesame bread..all delicious! With fluffy butter on the side, it was carb heavin - Squid--so aromatic. I loved the element of fried garlic and felt it tied everything together so perfectly - Duck--prepared wonderfully - Lobster--came with potato chips and asparagus. I was a little thrown off that the lobster was cold but felt like it was so fresh and not overdone in any way. It was a very light dish which I found refreshing -Foie Gras--didn't try this because it made me feel like an animal abuser but heard really good things from the company The Okay: - Bass--I thought it was really interesting the way they prepared this dish. They left it skin on which I don't usually like but scraped the skin in a way to get a really crunchy. This dish just wasn't that memorable compared to the others - Cabbage--This dish was entirely pickled which I actually liked! There were also chilis in it which gave it a nice flavor and rounded out everything. It was just a bit too salty which is why I put it in the Okay. Overall, I enjoyed my experience. I think across the board everything was a tad too salty for me but I would come back. It's great for a special occasion.
13258	414	5.0	1	2014-06-16	Seriously as good as it gets. The food is amazing, each dish was honestly delicious. Worth venturing out of Williamsburg, without question. Was lucky to go on a slow night so spent a long time talking about wine, which I love to do.
13259	414	5.0	1	2014-06-04	Deliciousness all around and server, Josh was a star.  Great vibes, great atmosphere and great assortment of seasonal delectables.
13260	414	5.0	1	2014-05-24	We had dinner reservations at the Pines last week.   We started with the BEEF TARTARE.  It is topped with sea urchin. We shared the FAVA BEAN salad.  I am a carnivore.  I hate vegetables and I don't even like lamb.  This was really good.   KELP UDON.  Also topped with uni. BORSA VUOTA was my favorite dish of the evening.  So good!  I think it is a mushroom pasta.  Very flavorful and rich. CULOTTE STEAK We split the Rubarb for dessert.  This wasn't my favorite dessert but it worked well as a palette cleanse and was perfect for this meal. We maybe have ordered one dish too many.  But everything was pretty perfect from cocktails to our waiter.  I can't wait to go back again and try everything else.
13261	414	5.0	1	2014-05-19	Dinner--black sea bass; udon with uni and a 6-minute egg; squid with ink romanesco; salad with bonito flakes; bread with house made butter... All dishes we'd have again. Good beer selection and cocktails. They charge $6 for the bread but it's worth it. We'll be back.
13262	414	5.0	1	2014-05-12	I love this restaurant. Had my second visit on Saturday night and was blown away as I was the first time.  While The Pines is pricey for the neighborhood, the food it certainly elevated over more causal places and its worth it for a splurge.   The manager told us there was an hour wait, the place was packed at 8:30pm on a Saturday, but he was helpful and suggested we eat in the backyard.  While the food was too casual for what we were looking for, we were able to have a drink back there and they came and got us when a table opened up. Service was amazing, they had a great wine by the glass selection, we left full, tipsy and already excited for the next visit. In the meantime, I plan on checking out the more casual backyard menu soon!
13263	414	5.0	1	2014-04-11	I went to the Pines with a group of friends and we all enjoyed our dining experience. The service was attentive and not over bearing. The atmosphere was cozy but not crammed. They have a nice outdoor area that I want to check out as soon as it warms up. As for the food, it was all great. I particularly enjoyed a pasta dish with homemade ricotta. It melted in my mouth. Lastly, who ever made the playlist of music for that evening won my heart. I love early 90s R&B. Will definitely dine here again.
13264	414	5.0	1	2014-04-07	This lovely restaurant is perfection. Had dinner here recently and was so satisfied. The space, food, service and even the bathroom are all top notch. Clean, pretty well lit and cozy. The food is super delicious. Get everything on the menu it's all amazing. The noodles, oysters, and tartar were my fave. They have a nice huge back area, really pretty it makes you want to stay forever. I highly highly recommend checking this place out, the waiters are really knowledgable and passionate about the food and wine there which I always appreciate because that's necessary so big cherry on top with that. Thanx Pines! Don't change a thing. I'll be back for sure, many times :)))
13265	414	4.0	1	2014-04-03	I took my husband there a couple of weeks ago for his birthday. I e-mailed the restaurant to make a reservation for the 5 course tasting menu and to find out if they can accommodate all of my food allergies. The chef came through for me big time. The food was incredible!!!!! Roasted carrots with a pistachio pesto, risotto with sea urchin and lobster, roasted cauliflower, red cabbage and hen of the wood mushrooms served with a slightly spicy scallion sauce., were just some of the dishes. Course after course the meal just kept getting better and better! I look forward to going back!!!!!! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the wine selection. The wines are organic and bio-dynamic, but these are funky and odd tasting. We were able to taste a few and i chose the least weird. The wines are expensive for what they are, ranging in price from $14-$19 a glass. If they were really good the price would not have been an issue.
13266	414	1.0	1	2014-04-02	I actually was taken here for my birthday 2 years ago (most likely when the original chef was there) and never went back.  The design, decor of the place is great. When we walked in though the place had a really bad smell (the first tip to tell you if anywhere is not going to have good food is that smell).   We order several dishes and drinks and all were overpriced and were less than mediocre.  I had a lukewarm chewy bloody beef medallion dish with vegetables that didn't bring any interesting or inspired taste.  My companion did not enjoy his dish either.  We were so hungry too... The bread was about the only thing that was edible.  This place was a COMPLETE WASTE of the $140+ that we paid.  It's been over 2 years and I still want my money back fir that experience.  Worst meal ever.
13267	414	4.0	1	2014-03-26	On a 2nd chance, totally loved this place.  First of all, going on a Saturday night the first time might have been a mistake - on a quiet Wed (though The Pines quickly filled up) gave us a more relaxed view.  Meals start with an amuse bouche - ours was a foamy soup with dried onion on top - just lovely.  Then a couple of cheeses with the excellent bread, a few salads and a yummy pasta with greens, hazelnuts and mushrooms.  The menu changes frequently - you may see something that was there a week ago, but tweaked - or a wholly new dish.  We were also offered a disgetif after dinner. And the cocktails are unimpeachable - The Pines, the signature cocktail, has rye, yuzu and fir essence. There are local gins, beer on tap and interesting combos.  Service is friendly and professional.  Yes, it is still expensive but I want to give The Pines a 3rd, 4th and 5th shot...
13268	414	5.0	1	2014-03-23	Amazing food, amazing people--whiskey with truffles and anything they recommend.
13269	414	5.0	1	2014-02-27	Eat here! This place is amazing!  I was skeptical after reading all the hype about this place, and then seeing the foodie fridge magnet style menu that lacked any details about the dishes.  We had a couple of inspired cocktails.  The cabbage and maitakes were available for me without the meat and were incredibly rich and flavorful.  The veg pasta was lemony and pure silk. What a treat.  Seriously.  Go now while it's cold out and you'll have all the deliciousness to yourself.
13270	414	5.0	1	2014-02-24	Absolutely love this place! I have been there for dinner twice and went for the Superbowl recently. Since it was superbowl, I wanted some beer (coming from a wine and vodka kind of a girl), and I literally tasted every beer on the menu before deciding - with nothing but graciousness from our server.  Also had the wagyu steak, which was as delicious and tender as it was beautiful.  Even the bread and butter is homemade and rave-worthy.   Favorite part is the non-pretentious vibe, which is hard to find.  People are just themselves, and the food speaks for itself. Will definitely be back. and back and back.
13271	414	5.0	1	2014-02-16	I went to the Pines recently for the second time. The first time this summer I sat outside in the backyard and I had roasted corn and kebabs. That was simple and delicious and the atmosphere was great. Recently I went for dinner and had the bass, that was also really good. Def recommend!
11224	414	5.0	1	2014-02-15	Really it's 4.5 stars but since I'm a glass-half-full person let me round it up to 5 stars. The food was really good all around. The amuse bouche was great - I really liked the sea salt in it. After 2 dinners here, we've had maybe one dish which wasn't top notch. The rest were really really excellent. Friendly service to go with it. Not the cheapest place but a very good one anyway.
13272	414	5.0	1	2014-02-12	I went here for Brunch when it first started and I must say the food was excellent. I ended up getting the Chorizo and the eggs. The Chorizo was just what I needed to hit the spot. I ended up taking the rest of my eggs home because I couldn't finish everything, but that tasted great as a leftover. I would recommend the bloody mary. It's hand made and has a nice kick to it to start your day.
9579	414	5.0	1	2014-02-11	Wow! Where am I eating dinner...Gowanus?!? I was so pleasantly surprised with the food and service in this hidden gem in Brooklyn. Admittedly, I went there only after ignoring the hype of friends who had gone before me and raved about the food. Finally, I needed to go for myself and I was AMAZED! My cocktail was expertly prepared by a very friendly bartender who I had mistakenly called Phil all night due to the blasting hip hop music. Volume withstanding the drink, the Quincy's Jam, was delicious with a touch of tart and plenty of booze. It is served in a vintage coupe glass that made me feel like I had traveled through time to the days when a bartender cared about his customer and did not try to rush dinner to get the next table seated.  For the record the bartender's name was Will and he is very very easy on the eyes! Onto dinner, after handsome Will thoroughly explained the menu items and ingredients, I was drooling and ready to gorge on everything! I settled on the bread which was a medley of fresh baked wheat baguette, seeded brioche, and some type of Italian deliciousness I can't remember-all served with this blend of cheese and butter. CHEESE AND BUTTER people and it was so good I nearly ate the entire batch alone. Next, I had a Sweet Potato plate with Brussels sprouts and pork fat with a touch of buttercream. The perfect sweet and savory combination. Oh I just remembered the bread had an olive oil drizzle and sea salt sprinkle...so tasty! Lastly, Will recommended the Duck Cappalacchi. I am positive I misspelled this dish but it is a delicious dumpling like pasta stuffed with braised duck meat in a scrumptious broth topped with mustard greens. Hands down the best meal I have had in Brooklyn by far, including Williamsburg-for all the food snobs out there on YELP, there is better food in BK than Wburg. My only regret was I did not save room for dessert. I saw a couple of gelato looking desserts pass my way, but after 3 drinks and a million questions about the menu, it was time for me to go. In sum, check this place out if you want a delicious meal, superior service, and some eye candy while you digest your meal. Better yet go there if you are tired of rude waiters or overcrowded small spaces and want an exquisite dining experience. One more shout out to the host or manager, Anthony, for providing me with a space to have dinner without a reservation. He was very accommodating and another piece of eye candy!
13273	414	5.0	1	2014-02-08	This is the second time that I've been here and I'm going to keep coming back cause I haven't tried everything on the menu yet.  The food is incredibly playful, mixing ingredients I would never imagine to pair together and it works really, really well.  I wish there was more vegetarian stuff for my friend, but the waiter made it possible to make some of the dishes vegetarian and still tasted great.  The service was knowledgable and nice.  Not stuffy at all.  The food seems like it should be in a stuffy restaurant, but it's in a comfortable wooden setting with friendly servers having a good time with you.  My only complaint was a lot of ice cream for dessert in the dead of winter.  Not interested in ice cream in the dead of winter.  Other than that, 5 stars, easy.
13274	414	5.0	1	2014-02-05	With an ever changing menu, I wouldn't want to recommend anything that may not be available so the only thing I can recommend is EVERYTHING! As it is all unique, delicious and like nothing you'll have anywhere else. Very cool place, they get the brooklyn chic right without being cliche and there is a great overall vibe. The kitchen is packed with young masterminds and their excellent food coupled with very nice service makes for a great experience. Will be back often.
13275	414	5.0	1	2014-02-02	i love going to a restaurant and knowing that i'm going to love anything i order that night for dinner.  i've been to the pines a handful of times since they opened, and always walk out thinking that that  meal was my favorite...every single time! but, what makes it always my favorite meal is that the space is chill, crowd is relaxed and the service is friendly.  it's like being at a very fun and interesting friend's dinner party.  everyone's there to have a nice evening, so there's this great buzz in the air.   stand out plates:  foie, chanterelle, cavatelli, and pork shoulder stand out cocktails:  the pines and the uncle buck can't wait to go back!
13276	414	5.0	1	2014-02-02	Was visiting from LA and was told by friends I had to check this place out. Really glad I did. Super cool spot. Great friendly staff. Really interesting menu. Cool crowd of people. Just an overall good scene. Will definitely return on my next trip out to NY.
13277	414	5.0	1	2014-02-02	I never write reviews, but my wife and I had such amazing food here I had to take the time to do so.  From our well crafted and unique cocktails and every beautiful plate that was brought out to us, each item wonderfully delicious.  We loved it so much that it was the first place we both thought of when we picked a place for a Valentine's day dinner.  I highly recommend The Pines for a date or dinner with friends or family.
13278	414	5.0	1	2014-01-31	I took my brother here for his birthday two years in a row and both times it was an amazing experience.  The vibe and décor are unpretentious and inviting.  The wait staff is attentive and friendly as well, and the bartenders are some of my favorite around.  They know the food and the menu, and make a captivating assortment of delicious drinks. Oh and did I mention that the food is incredible?  I love that the menu changes often so I can always look forward to a new exciting dish when I come, accompanied by some of my favorite staples.  Everything was extremely well seasoned throughout our entire meal, and we ate a nice variety of vegetables, protein, and desserts.  The cabbage dish blew me away.  Who knew a plate of cabbage, mushrooms, and cauliflower could taste so good?  You can really taste the love that goes into their house made pasta, and it's always accompanied by original, interesting ingredients. The bread is delicious as well and the desserts really push the envelope, in a good way.  They make you think twice about combining sweet and savory flavors, and somehow they always make it work.  You are left wondering how something that sounds so out of the box, tastes so amazing! By the end of both my meals, I left feeling happy, full, and excited to return again in the near future.
13279	414	5.0	1	2014-01-30	I NEVER write reviews. NEVER. Buy I have to for this. I've been to The Pines twice in the last 2 months and can't get enough. The decor, the food and the people really make this Gowanus gem stand out. First, the decor reminds me of that house in Fight Club but in the best way possible. It's like Martha Stewart meets Gowanus or like a French bulldog in a puffy coat- Ugly Cute. It's equal parts homey and grungy. Pitch perfect BK ambience. Next, the food. TRY EVERYTHING, or at least as much as you can. It's some of the most interesting and equally delicious food you can find hands down. Duck confit muffins with foie-sting? Stop. They even made a plate of cabbage to die for. Definitely get the cabbage. Lastly, the people. I LOVED our servers when we went. They remembered our names, knew what they were talking about when it came to pairings and which cocktails fit our mood. And they were down right charming.
13280	414	5.0	1	2014-01-29	One of my top three favorite restaurants in all of New York. The atmosphere is perfection and the food is outstanding. I came for a celebratory dinner with my closet friends and family, and the family style tasting menu was unbelievably delicious. The drinks are great and the service is top notch. I've also been for brunch, which was equally as delightful. The chorizo breakfast sandwich was a standout- and I didn't even order it- I just got a taste of my friend's. The lamb bacon was also to die for. Sitting out back for a cold beer in the summer is also my jam!
13281	414	5.0	1	2014-01-28	4.5, but I'm rounding up.  My wife and I went to the Pines in summer of this year and were really impressed.  I remember having an uni dish with puffed amaranth, a wagyu steak with kimchi, and a foie gras dish.  The portions are incredibly generous, beautifully plated, and creative.  We just went again last night and I feel compelled to write a review as it was better than our first visit.  The service was warm and friendly and the food was some of the best I've had in recent months--and we are avid foodies.  Although our waiter suggested five plates, three or four probably would have sufficed.  We started with the bread and cultured butter which came with about five large hunks of bread and a generous pat of delicious butter, that almost had a cheesy quality to it.  Next was braised cabbaged, boar belly, delicious maitake mushrooms, and a scallion cream.  Beautiful, gorgeous, and inspired.  Maybe a bit on the salty side, but the dish was absolutely pure bliss!  Then we had the crispy veal sweetbreads, honey mushrooms, escarole, and butternut squash cream.  So good.  The ingredients are treated with such care and finesse, the final product is so wonderful.  We ended with the agnolotti filled with ricotta and parsnip, in a broth of its own whey, topped with black truffles.  Such a subtle dish--the creamy sweet ricotta paired with teh sourness of the whey was wonderful.  The five dishes, with a glass of wine, at $110.  Seriously, not bad at all considering the quality and quantity they give you.  We hope to be back sooner rather than later.
13282	414	5.0	1	2014-01-26	The cabbage. No one ever talks about cabbage, why would they? But seriously the cabbage served with boar belly bacon and scallion purée made my night. The wine list is interesting (all organic & additive free). I found the staff to be knowledgeable and super friendly. Really cool spot for a night of epicurean delights. Also they aren't cash only anymore! Go eat there now.
13283	414	5.0	1	2014-01-22	Went here with 2 friends on a Friday night in December. Food was some of the best I have had in all of 2013 and it was absolutely delicious. We each picked 3 dishes that we would like, and we then all shared it when served. We got one dish at a time and just digged in when served - absolutely great way to share a meal at this spot. Drinks was out of this world as well.
13284	414	5.0	1	2014-01-21	This place is so wonderful.  The space is unique and cozy, drinks are great, and the food is like nothing else in the area, or really anywhere.  I took my out-of-town foodie relatives for dinner over a year ago and they are STILL raving about (and remembering) each course.  The cool thing about the Pines is that It rivals any fancy tasting menu while still remaining approachable and relaxed.  The combination of textures and flavors is always surprising, but as soon as you taste it... it makes so much sense.  Oh, and if there's pasta on the menu, GET IT.
13285	414	5.0	1	2014-01-16	what an awesome little spot!! go on a cold winter night- feels like you've been transported to a cozy winter cabin far far away from the city. while the scene is enough to make the trip (their backyard is awesome year round- chiminea and s'mores out back on the cold nights!!) the food happens to be knock-your-socks-off good. listen really closely to what the server has to say about each dish- there's so much detail- you can really tell how much work and thought goes into each creation. straight up classy stuff served in a very homey, unassuming way. awesome wine list, too!
13286	414	5.0	1	2014-01-16	Awesome food, great drinks, nice backyard. Nice little spot in out of the way Gowanus has lots of cutting edge food with a menu that is totally different every time we go. My favorite is sitting in the back yard with their extensive french cider menu (wine bottle sized, perfect for two people), their big selection of natural and interesting wines, and a lot of the really interesting modern styled cooking (foams, sous vide, etc.) that makes for great meat dishes that aren't just big steaks plopped on a plate.
13287	414	4.0	1	2014-01-02	NYE tasting menu was interesting and, at times, magical.  There was a serious problem with pastry - every bread item on the menu was served cold and, seemingly, stale.  If corned duck cappellacci sticks around on the menu, it would be worth a return trip.
13288	414	4.0	1	2013-12-07	Have come here twice now.  The team from Little Neck on the same block has done it again.  The food is completely different than over at little neck.  The decor is clearly less nautical and is basically basement chic.  But don't let that grungy appearance deter you from enjoying some creative cuisine.   The menu both times was very similar so it allowed me to try lots of different things. The first go around I had the foie gras dish with brioche, the carrot dish and the waygu steak that I split with a friend.  Don't let them tell you that you need 4-5 dishes.  Even for this hefty fellow and big eater, three were fine.   The second go around, I shared with the wife, the cabbage (house cured boar belly), the duck special and the sweet breads.  Plenty full and no room for dessert.   The staff was super friendly as well.   Looking forward to a return trip.
13289	414	4.0	1	2013-11-20	I am giving this little Gowanus restaurant four stars, for several reasons. First, the waiter, who was new but trying very hard, and second, for the lovely glass of wine I finally got, although it was $16 a glass (better than the $19/glass I tasted first). Okay, and I loved my first little plate of chanterelles, egg and salad. Unfortunately, as many other reviewers have noted, the food and wine were as highly priced as the most sophisticated new restaurant on Smith Street or in Williamsburg, without the expected consistency or ambiance. Some of the food was great, but some was..  inedible. (Do not, whatever you do, order the mackerel with raw uni.) Although I admit they were great about it. They brought something else and didn't charge me -- which is yet another reason for four stars rather than three. As for the ambiance, it was fine for a low-key wine bar. It was just too downmarket -- the peeling paint, the warehouse feeling -- for an expensive, high-end dinner. My advice would be to polish just a bit -- not too much -- but just a bit. And maybe a little less peeling paint.
13290	414	4.0	1	2013-11-13	Such a lovely dinner! Me and my boyfriend went there to try a new place in the hood, and we had such a wonderful meal. The place really looks like a Berlin-based restaurant, not the usual Brooklyn-vintage-style that you can find everywhere in these days. Meal was excellent. We had appetizers of cheese selection and fish. Then two main meal of ravioli with rabbit, broccoli and cheese, and a mules seafood soup. It's really interesting how the chef mix food culture and traditions. You will be surprised! Maybe it's a little bit pricy, but it is worth. Oh and they keep bringing free samples to try new chef experiments. Can't wait to go back!
13291	414	5.0	1	2013-11-09	Really good addition to 3rd ave. The weight staff were very nice and super helpful. The drinks are delicious and the food was exceptional. Friendly atmosphere and great local food.
13292	414	4.0	1	2013-10-18	"Absolutely delicious! Went to The Pines with two other adventurous eaters and opted for the cheese appetizer (2 for $10), 3 of the ""Markets"" (~$15 per plate) and the Rabbit (yes, Rabbit) for 2 (around $60).   The bread accompanying the cheese was perfectly crusty and chewy  but the cheese selection was pretty small. ""Cabbage"" was a highlight and it came sauteed with Maitake mushrooms and some type of crispy pancetta/bacon. I really wanted to eat the whole plate by myself. ""Carrot"" was well dressed but I don't remember much of the accompanying elements. ""Gem Lettuce"" was the only salad type place they had and was very refreshing. Dressing was on point and the bonito flakes added an umami flavor that resembled the addition of anchovis in a ceasar salad. Now the Rabbit... It came 4 ways... 1) In a ragu sauce over housemade pasta 2) the leg confit 3) the loin wrapped in bacon 4) the ribs (or really...rib-lets). The first course of the rabbit ragu was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. It had such an earthy, rich taste that was appropriately brightened with herbs. We pretty much licked the bowl clean. While the other rabbit items were all tender, rich and delicious, the plate lacked something to tie it all together. It came with shaved raw maitakes that were OK but didn't really add much to the dish. I think it really needed a shmear of polenta or some type of starch to get more of an ""entre"" feel. Overall, left very satisfied and excited to come back. Definitely on the high end for price but you get what you pay for and a menu that changes daily based on local/farm ingredients isn't cheap."
11069	414	5.0	1	2013-10-17	Best farm to table restaurant!!! The atmosphere is very friendly, almost family like and the food is to die for. Definitely locally sourced products. I had the foie gras and the charcuterie plate as appetizers. I also tasted the pork and a salad. Everything tasted so delicious. I cannot wait to go back. Such an amazing experience.
13293	414	5.0	1	2013-10-10	An adventure in eating! I love The Pines because it feels like every time I go, I get to learn about a new food item or cooking technique I've never heard of. Go with your adventurous friends and ask questions, go with the servers' recommendations, just enjoy yourself! This is a place that feels like it was designed by a chef who makes what he feels like eating - very exciting, delicious and flavorful dishes. Also, cool music and a funky atmosphere inside. I've never tried the backyard grill, but it looks like they have a casual, tasty menu online and I'd love to check it out. This place is pure Gowanus awesomeness! A casual, hip spot to try something new.
13294	414	4.0	1	2013-10-02	"an incredible meal was had at the pines. this spot is a little pricey - with 2 drinks (1 mixed, 1 beer) and a shared entree - we still spent $200 with tip. that said, we also made our way through the menu from top to bottom starting with the cheese plate. it comes with an outstanding amount of breads and delicious cheeses. we asked for some of the caraway butter (which comes with the bread dish, not the cheese dish).  I recommend you ask for and taste before leaving. we made our way next to the foie gras which was velvety rich and divine - just like you want and expect your foie gras to be! next we had the persling salad with egg. this was a nice ""in between""  to have after the foi gras and before hitting the next two entrees that we ordered. razor clam pasta was fresh and flavorful (however our least favorite dish of them all). our last dish was the waygu beef with kimchi and it was just melt in your mouth outstanding. too full for dessert, we rolled out of there still talking about the amazing meal that was had at the pines!"
13295	414	4.0	1	2013-08-30	Unique combinations of flavors and ingredients. Great lighting, nice date spot. Just hope that you're not the one paying because it will likely cost you upwards of $150. There was a bottle of wine on the menu for $192! Then again, the place did draw a diverse crowd (including a little old lady in a gold dress). The menu is for sharing. There is a nice selection of raw local cheeses from Vermont, NY, and Pennsylvania. The bread comes a little burnt but I think that's part of the aesthetic or its just a new thing that people are doing. The octopus tasted fresh and the pasta was super al dente, just the way I like it. The service was good but not without the standard snobbery that hot spots or whatever just can't avoid. I like to be smiled at! 4 stars because it was truly delicious and one of a few nicer restaurants in this burgeoning area. They also accommodated our late arrival.
13296	414	4.0	1	2013-08-17	After a wildly negative experience months back, my dining partner-in-crime/BFF and I decided to give The Pines another chance. Why not? We both read some great reviews from trusted sources, so we felt like we must've gotten them on an off night. Or something. So we went back for dinner on a rainy, muggy Tuesday evening, and the place was packed. I did have some flashbacks to being deserted at our table for several minutes, but all anxious thoughts were forgotten soon into this meal. Our plan of attack was one dish from each section (minus the pasta). We had a very attentive and knowledgeable waiter, who even swapped out our first glasses of wine that for us were simply not enjoyable. Apparently they dig the earthy, funky varietals at this place. Okay. So long as I get wine that I can drink, I'm cool with that. The kitchen surprised us with an amuse-bouche - a delightful sorbetto with mint. We got some hudson valley goat/cow's milk cheese blend to start, which comes with a hefty hunk of crusty bread. A promising beginning. We moved onto a spicy octopus with melon. Mmm. Hot and sweet, very nice. We also got a cucumber dish that had different types of cucumbers stacked neatly. Very inventive, simple yet smart and balanced. And finally, duck. With a smoky barbecue-like sauce. It almost tasted as if the duck was smoked in some way, but I think it was just the sauce. Who knows. I do know it was delicious and we demolished the plate, along with everything else. With a surprise dessert from the kitchen to top it off, we left with very good tastes in our mouths (literally and figuratively this time, thankfully). My only complaint was the pacing: the cheese, octopus and cucumber appetizers were thrown at us within three minutes of each other, even though our waiter gave us a bit of an itinerary for the night which specifically involved cheese first, then the other apps as they came out of the kitchen, then the duck. After the onslaught of appetizers, we waited an absurdly long amount of time for our duck entree, to the point that we were a little concerned they had forgotten about it. So now I get it. The Pines serves inventive, creative, well thought-out dishes that with a little more focus as they seem to have now that they've been open for some time, is well worth it.
13297	414	5.0	1	2013-08-14	I cant say enough good things about my experience at the Pines. The staff was amazing.. friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, fun, etc etc. The food was just as good, if not better. I'm a vegetarian (I know, I know) so given the menu, I was really just going to the pines for my significant other. They were very accommodating to me... and the veggie stuff should DEFINITELY be put on the menu. The veggie pasta is to die for. Seriously. My favorite app was also the gem lettuce... much better then it sounds. I wish this restaurant was closer to me, so I could go every night. HIGHLY recommended
13298	414	3.0	1	2013-08-03	"Got to ""The Pines"" at 6:30 on a Friday and was delighted to hear they had an open table, even though reservations are highly recommended (wish it said that on their site).  The service was fantastic, the lovely gentlemen took care of everything we needed and answered every question I had-  even when I asked if ""The Pines"" was a nod to the Fire Island ""Pines""? Apparently  it had nothing to with it, although there were plenty of handsome boys!  With that said, although the service was great, I really felt it was way overpriced. Two people sharing the recommended 4-6 dishes, two drinks each, $180 with tip. The meal was good, but not THAT good, and neither were the serving sizes, it was a good thing we got the bread (which is delicious).  And the thing that may or may not bother some people, but I'm in the service industry, so it bothers me: ""The Pines"" is cash only, however, you will conveniently find an ATM where you can withdrawal money so they'll make a profit off of you having to pay in cash.  If a meal is going to be over $100 and you're putting yourself in an higher class restaurant category, get a credit card machine."
13299	414	4.0	1	2013-08-03	My husband and I tried The Pines for dinner last night and had a wonderful experience. The service was very attentive and the assortment of dishes we tried were delicious. It is on the pricier side, but I think the attention to detail and service warrants the cost.   The menu changes daily, but if you see the cabbage salad as  an option, try it out - surprising flavor profile of spicy and sweet.
13300	414	2.0	1	2013-07-26	Bizarre, eccentric menu and slow-as-molasses service adds up to a subpar dining experience at this Gowanus eatery. Pick jowl or pigeon or pigs' feet--the choice is yours. Either way, the wait will be yours, too. Not worth it.
13301	414	4.0	1	2013-07-26	Had a great experience here last night!  I had to chime in since the mixed reviews on here had me hesitating- but now I'm convinced that The Pines is well worth the trek. We sat inside since the bar menu outside is limited to small plates; the garden is sweet and would make a great weekend afternoon drinking spot.  $3 Budweisers make that likely in my future. Our window table was slightly awkward but the decor is Brooklyn semi-fance and comfortable.  It wasn't too packed; it was nice to have a reservation and we were seated right away. Service was above and beyond.  When we waited a bit too long for our drinks, they were comped- and we never waited too long between courses.  Our lovely server was attentive & generous with her time, since the cryptic menu begs for explanation.  I went with her recommendations and was impressed with: the variety on the salumi plate, the decadence of the fois gras (could be a dessert), and the rich simplicity of my duck agnolatti.  All could have used a bit more of their amazing bread for dipping and spreading, but when we asked, we received- so plus points for less waste! The dessert menu was surprisingly slim, but when the savory menu is ever-changing, you can't be fooling around with your sweets every night.  Overall I was impressed with the ingredients, simplicity & share-ability.  I'd love to try the outside bar menu, and whatever they invent as the seasons change!         The somewhat high price point will keep this place reserved for special occasions- this is still next to Gowanus, after all.  That being said, I look forward to the next special occasion!
13302	414	1.0	1	2013-07-22	"I made the awful mistake of having ""brunch"" at The Pines yesterday and it was by far my worst dining experience in the 20 years I've lived in NYC.  Let me recap: I arrive solo at 12:45 for a 1pm table of 5.  When I arrive the place was dead, and also ~5 degrees warmer than the heat-waved sidewalk. I ask for a bloody mary and the bartender says I'm lucky bc they only have enough mix left for about 3.  I ask what time brunch ends and she said 3pm. I mentioned that we have a table of 5 coming in and asked if she'd put aside one drink's worth for the bday boy (which she did).  When I mentioned having a reservation she looked puzzled and said that there were no reservations in the book for today.  I should note that a non NYer in my group found this place and made the reservation, and she did so about two weeks back.  I looked at the book with her, which had no entries in the time/date grid, and then spotted our reservation written small in the corner, versus being on the grid.  Odd. Anyhow, I remained optimisted and glanced the menu, which was about as anti-brunch as any brunch menu I've ever seen. A total of seven items -- three of them fish -- with no eggs or anything else remotely brunch-like.  I remained positive while chatting with the bartender and mentioned that it was a very whimsical menu, and asked her what her favorite item was.  She went through the list saying why each dish was great (not what I asked her) and then went on to mention that they might already be out of a couple of their [seven] choices.  Really?! At this point my spidey senses were tingling big time. My party arrives [on time] and we're sat.  By that time a pretty decent crowd had amassed in the dining room, which was somewhat reassuring.  We were given warm, ice-less water (in their hotter-than-outside restaurant) and proceed to sit for -- I shit you not -- 45 minutes with nothing but our warm water.  We asked for ice and they eventually came back with a water pitcher that had a handful of mostly melted ice cubes at the top, and then went on to top off our warm water glasses (making almost no difference to the temp).  To confirm, we did place a drink order about 30 minutes prior, at which time they announced the lack of bloody mix (short of the one they saved for me) and so the rest of the table ordered their only other drink option -- a grapefruit juice mimosa.  After we got our 45 minute melted ice refresh we asked about the drinks, only to find out they they WERE OUT OF GRAPEFRUIT JUICE.  We should have walked out at that point but I refrained from pushing bc I already had the person in my group who chose the place feeling bad, and I could tell she wanted to ride it out and seen if the food brought any redemption (it didn't).  Anyway, we were told that they were at that very moment squeezing fresh OJ to get us drinks (never even asked if orange was ok).  15 minutes later (the ONE HOUR mark), we were brought the most lackluster mimosas ever, most of the let down being the 45 minute wait for the drinks to arrive.  I should also note, btw, that the bloody mary mix was absolute crap: Watery, no horseradish, extremely underwhelming.  Oh, and they used a jigger to measure out the single shot of vodka, so it was both crappy AND stingy. So somewhere in that first hour we placed our food order -- never being told they were out of anything -- and when the meal finally dropped (at 2:15pm -- the first food we've seen all day, including no bread, for our 1pm reservation), we find out that, AFTER ALL THAT TIME, one of the items ordered was out, which amounted to one of us not being served anything.  So four of us sat there with food, sharing portions with the 5th, while the kitchen ""scrambled""  to bring out the alternate dish they recommended to our unlucky party member: some salmon crudo.  It took them 15 minutes to throw together a plate that consisted of 5 pieces of salmon sashimi strewn amidst pieces of torn rye sandwich bread (with a sauce drizzle of some sort).  THAT took 15 minutes??!!  Christ, after all we've been through they should have had that out in 15 SECONDS, especially given what a simple/boring dish it was.  The rest of us were done when the salmon finally arrived. The entire meal should have been comped. It wasn't (very little was).  The Pines should be ashamed of itself for their disgraceful performance. Amateur hour x1000. And all this comes from a bonafide foody with YEARS of fine dining service experience, btw. EDIT: In the interest of fairness I want to point out that the owner has contacted me directly and offered to make amends by way of a refund.  A very professional and classy move, and a greatly appreciated gesture. Had this been offered by the manager yesterday (I don't believe the owner was present) it definitely would have diffused (or altogether squashed) this review. Also, I do want to mention that the lamb bacon (from my Lamb BLT) was stellar."
13303	414	4.0	1	2013-07-16	Food was very good and the service was great!  The items I thought were a little over priced. Nice atmosphere though!
13304	414	3.0	1	2013-06-24	Very good, but CASH ONLY and quite expensive for 3rd Ave Bklyn. I make it a habit to avoid restaurants that don't care enough about their customers to allow them the convenience of accepting plastic. I won't be back until they do.
13305	414	4.0	1	2013-06-07	Outside, glorious Like a diamond in the rough Enjoyable beers.
8817	414	4.0	1	2013-05-31	Excellent food! I read about this place on seriouseats so we decided to check it out before rock climbing at BK Boulders. It's a very low-key spot with an unpretentious vibe with a friendly staff and a great menu. I liked the space as well along with the mismatched furniture. It's a little bit like grungy chic, if you will. The brunch was delightful! I ordered the mushroom hash - 2 kinds of potatoes, wild mushrooms, egg, and cheese. The combination was wonderfully savory and delicious. My bf had the chorizo sandwich - a spicy house made chorizo topped with avocado. It was also very good. They have brunch cocktails of course but I opted to have coffee instead. They use a French press and there's nothing like really good coffee made in this manner. To top it all off we had a slice of strawberry balsamic pie. The pie comes from the a bakery nearby so credit goes to them but it went great with the rest of the meal. I'd definitely want to come back here again  and check out their dinner menu. They are also opening up their backyard for the summer so that's something I look forward to.
13306	414	4.0	1	2013-05-27	Originally posted that I wasn't thrilled with the meal.  The owner contacted me via yelp and that was a really stand up thing to do. Will give it another try. Thanks!
13307	414	1.0	1	2013-05-20	Are you fucking kidding me? A restaurant where a light meal comes out to $140 taking cash only?  HOW IS THE IRS NOT AUDITING THE SHIT OUT OF THIS SHITHOLE?  I was so tempted to not tip and just tell the servers to get their tips from their obvious tax-cheat boss. The octopus was good - it's hard to fuck up octopus.  The umi/sea urchin/whatever was the most disgusting food I have ever eaten.  I have no idea what they did to the texture or how they cooked it but the chef managed the seemingly impossible - make one of my favorite foods utterly inedible.  I seriously felt sick after my first bite.  The pork shoulder, which our inattentive waitress recommended, was basically thick slabs of pastrami. Who are the people giving this place higher than 2 stars? You guys seriously need to get out more.
13308	414	1.0	1	2013-05-05	"We had every expectation of enjoying a good meal here, so was surprised to have what was undoubtedly the worst meal we've had in recent memory. The word ""slop"" comes to mind.  The service, however, was very good and the atmosphere is charming. If our meal had been just middling, these qualities would probably have prevented me from submitting a bad review.  Our octopus appetizer was pretty decent, but our entrees -- pork shoulder and lamb neck -- were simply terrible, flavor-wise and presentation-wise. It felt like bizarro world, where we couldn't wrap our brains around how anybody could think those flavors worked.  We've always liked Littleneck, its sister restaurant, so this really threw us for a loop. I actually feel a little nauseated thinking about it..."
13309	414	3.0	1	2013-05-03	The service was attentive. The brunch menu was very limited; but certain things stuck out. The side of Cinnamon Toast was almost awesome, but too salty. The Pork Sandwich was good but the kimchi was spicy to the point of being inedible; and we like spice. The Polenta was good. In retrospect, I would've tried the Chorizo.   The Bloody Mary tasted too fishy, like too much clam juice or something... but the Green Juice + Gin was the tits. That combo suggestion should be on the brunch menu. Good coffee program, and presentation. Nice backyard. Overall, I just prefer this as a pre-meal drink stop vs. a restaurant. But there was this one night, when we stopped in for a drink before a reservation at Littleneck... and The Pines was pretty crowded, so we almost just backed out for that reason. But the host told us we could order a drink at the bar, through him, and then whisked us out of sight, into this sad looking clump of people at the back of the restaurant. It was an inhumane huddled mass of people desperately grasping their cocktails and beers, as if those were adequate justification of the circumstances at hand. We knew better and fled the dumpy corral of displaced bodies.
13310	414	5.0	1	2013-04-30	Exceptional food with interesting and intensely flavorful combinations.  The whole meal is like a delicious science experiment for your mouth!  The ambiance is rustic and charming.   BUT the BEST part about this place is the owner who takes a genuine interest and concern in the customers to make sure they have an enjoyable experience. Exceptionally nice guy who is invested in the people of the neighborhood and not just solely interested in turning a profit, which is a rare find in a restaurateur in NYC! I definitely recommend this place.  It's not just dinner, it's an experience.
13311	414	5.0	1	2013-04-30	Outstanding food, drinks, service, and atmosphere. This is one of my favorite new restaurants in Brooklyn. The chef's ability to highlight and mix flavors in a unique way really stands out to me. And, on the flip side, the bread and cheese selections are amazing! Very happy, will definitely be back!
13312	414	3.0	1	2013-04-24	Food was good, although portions were small.  The biggest surprise, though, is that they don't take any credit cards!  There is an ATM machine in the restaurant, but it charges a fee of $1.75.
13313	414	3.0	1	2013-04-12	I was a bit torn on this one.... The service was great, the crowd was young and hip, the atmosphere is good and the food was good (but not great). I would normally give 4 stars for good but not great food with all those other pluses but when I drop $150 (for 2 people) on a few small plates and a few beers, AND I need a sandwich after, it needs to be damn good food. Especially in the heart of the Gowanus. Long story short, it's a great place to go with friends if you don't mind spending a little more than you should.
13314	414	1.0	1	2013-04-10	wow what a disaster. the mixed reviews are telling. i can say i have eaten at some insane high end places and one thing i hate is this exact kind of posing that the chef is doing here. first of all the food is badly seasoned and the portion sizes are borderline ridiculous. then its overpriced. and then, they bring out the food, basically explaining it to you as if that's somehow enlightening - i mean the explanation just summarizes the components on the menu - it's like: actually, i can read btw... -- so don't insult me by presenting these dishes to me as if they were some sort of spontaneous top chef novelty. sure, the plating could mislead some into thinking that but the basic fact is that the food isn't even good !!! the dishes not only don't make sense but they're also seriously lacking seasoning and are in some sense mis-seasoned... sure, they contain what some may consider esoteric components (caviar, black garlic etc) but if only the chef was competent to actually make a convincing dish out of that i could forgive all the rest. the pork shoulder was off the bone and sliced up into little pieces. fine - but then why are you giving me a huge steak knife? sauce was decent but mega rich... and then the amuse-bouche - something that could be considered charming but instead i am getting some badly flavored garbanzo bean nonsense? i mean wtf... the best part literally as many have said is the bread - but a huge plate of warmed bread and caraway seed butter... sure, it's gonna be great. but i wouldn't really call it gourmet. i'd say stay away. my girlfriend was very sad after our meal - at having spent so much money on such terrible food. avoid!
13315	414	5.0	1	2013-04-08	I love this place. So beautiful, great service and food is delicious and unusual. We have been twice and loved the bread with caraway butter, the apples in sheep smile yogurt, and the pici pasta with duck ragu.
13316	414	1.0	1	2013-04-08	I am a very big foodie and have been to some of the most amazing restaurants out there, but this place.... The food is horrible.  The chef overreaches with what he is trying to do.  The duck filled pasta, however, was great, but that was it out of 8 dishes.  Never will I go back.
13317	414	2.0	1	2013-04-06	Some hits and misses, but too many misses for the price.  We sat at the bar near the kitchen, and the bartender was nice and helpful in terms of both drinks and telling us about the menu.  We started with the Jicama, and overall I think this was my favorite dish of the night.  It was fresh, and the sea urchin and guanciale worked surprisingly well together. My wife had the cappellaci and it was SUPER heavy and rich - too much so, for our tastes.  I had the aged duck, which sounded really great and probably would have been if it had been rendered/crisped a bit more.  Instead the breast came out with pale, yellow-ish skin and a LOT of the fat under it.  So it was juicy and not over-cooked, but it would have been much better if it had been crisped more.   I'd say stick with Littleneck.  Oh, and cash only is annoying given the prices.
13318	414	1.0	1	2013-03-31	I've lived in New York for a while now. The Pines was, to date, the worst place I've eaten so far in the City (specifically Brooklyn). Waitress was pushy, annoying, and arrogant. Portions were ridiculously small. Presentation was comical it was so bad. Food was average at best, and overpriced. It's astounding to me that this place is still in business actually.
13319	414	4.0	1	2013-03-28	portions on the smaller side but interesting and tasty! mellow. i would def go back.
13320	414	5.0	1	2013-03-02	My overall experience at The Pines was wonderful. We arrived as walk ins while it was already quite busy. We grabbed drinks from the bar and headed out to the courtyard. While waiting we enjoyed sitting beside a campfire. The owner of the restaurant was outside and offered us S'mores. We passed on them, but enjoyed them after dinner. Our first course was the Testa, a dish that we had no idea what to expect. It was quite good. The mix of head cheese, huckleberries and celery was a great combination. Next we had the Jicama salad.The combination and textures of the jicama, coconut and sea urchin were unique and interesting. I was not crazy about the salad, but I did find it to be very fun and inventive compared to my average salad. Next came the Bone Marrow. Having never had marrow before I was nervous and excited at what the experience would be like. I must say I loved it. The presentation was excellent. A large, natural dish with heaping portions of bread beside it. Next arrived the Monk Fish. I enjoyed this plate very much, especially the broth it came in.. Our final dish was what knocked my socks off. The Ox Tail Cappelacci with shaved black truffle on top. These flavorful little envelopes possessed the stinky truffle aroma; and a flavor that was incredible. I think I could eat these every day. The environment was very warm, conversations sparked with tables beside us about the food and wine. It was very fun to interact with the other diners, which I find doesnt happen all that frequently. The service was great. My glass was always full with the cucumber infused water, and my wine was always filled without me even noticing. The servers were also knowledgable about the food and the wine offerings. After the meal we returned outside and enjoyed the fire and friendly conversations with patrons and staff members. An excellent evening!
13321	414	1.0	1	2013-02-28	"This place has some edible food, but not a lot. We came in on a rainy evening after finding that Littleneck was closed. My girlfriend is a pescatarian, so we ordered the shrimp appetizer, and one vegetarian pasta (special order--This place is not vegetarian friendly) and for me, a trotters (pork foot) pasta. Our waitress was the standout of the evening. She was helpful and attentive, and she helped us make sense of the oddly worded menu. Really, it was more like talking point for her than a menu. The shrimp still lingers with us as a bad memory. It tasted like what I imagine worms in formaldehyde taste like. Mercifully, our waitress took it away and didn't charge us for it. She very kindly replaced it with an odd sweet potato dish free of charge. It definitely was edible, and thoughtfully put together, but too abrasive for an appetizer. The pici & ragu -- well, if you've had one fancy ragu, you've had'em all. The ""pici"" are basically wonton noodles and the bowl its served in hints at wonton also. The vegetarian version wasn't great either. This place considers itself Brooklyn-Fancy enough to charge high prices, but it's really just overly-experimental mediocre food. We really appreciated our waitress though. PS -- still feeling very put off by the shrimp (amaebi)."
9501	414	3.0	1	2013-02-22	It was the best of dinners, it was the worst of dinners. I have been meaning to dine at The Pines for quite some time (divine rhymes in that line, I opine), but a combination of winter and my lady friend's justifiable hatred for the R Train had kept us away thus far. Perhaps it was the combination of anticipation and glowing reports from a few trusted friends that led to out-sized expectations, but unfortunately the end result was a touch underwhelming. This is not to say that anything was bad; I just found dinner to be uneven. There were ups and downs, flashes of brilliance coupled with baffling choices; disappointingly though, the only underlying theme of the experience seemed to be that of an out-sized markup. We arrived early on a weeknight which in Gowanus will usually add up to being immediately seated, and this was no exception. Each of the large number of staff members we encountered during our meal was exceptionally friendly, and yet it took more than 10 minutes before we were offered a drink. We spent the time poring over the menu, which is peppered with so many unique ingredients (nduja, crosnes, uni, abalone mushroom, testa) that one almost wonders if novelty was the driving force behind their choices, rather than flavor. When we finally were able to order a cocktail, I, a bourbon man, couldn't resist the Baked Apple. I'm all for innovation, and I appreciated the theater involved in the bourbon and cider combination being poured in a glass that arrives full of smoke. Personally though, I found the woodsmoke to be completely overpowering, and the overall effect lacked the balance I would expect from a $14 cocktail.* We started with the apples that came highly recommended by our server, and the flavors were fresh and light and unimpeachable. In truth, one of the healthiest things I've eaten at a restaurant in quite some time, and I enjoyed the dish thoroughly. However, it was literally just wedges of apple, tossed in a bit of yogurt and sprinkled with black sesame. This is a kid's snack,** but one that ran us $11. The pastas on the menu both appealed to us, and we decided on the cappellacci. These mid-sized ravioli were filled with braised oxtail in a tomato based sauce, and they were absolutely delicious. However, at $28, it worked out to around $5 per little piece of pasta. Of course, I'm sure we were actually paying for the substantial amount of grated black truffle, but it lacked the sweet and earthy flavor I anticipated. (Perhaps it was grated too long before serving?) We also opted for the duck, and it was masterfully cooked. Although it appeared as though it could be soggy, the skin was crisp, the meat tender, and the blood orange gelee was an excellent touch of acid. I was a bit bewildered by the inclusion of ostensibly seared, undoubtedly raw hearts of palm, but the duck was satisfying and at $24, appropriately priced. The space itself, other than the wood paneling by the tables in the windows, takes shabby chic to new levels. It's almost as if they are striving to offer as great a contrast as possible between the quality of the food [and the prices] and the room in which you eat it. I can appreciate such a contradiction, but the execution fell a little flat, especially considering I dropped $100 (cash only) on a meal consisting of three dishes and one drink. In sum, The Pines confuses me. Perhaps it's just me, and the flavors aren't in my wheelhouse. After all, confusion is not necessarily a bad thing...but when I drop a bill on dinner, I'd rather by satisfied than confused. _____________ *Yes, a $14 cocktail. No longer the $12 listed on the online menu, and the ingredients of the Baked Apple in particular seem to have changed as well. Perhaps because honeycrisp apples are no longer in season?  Either way, in my mind, this is a price point that needs to be justified by quality, and in this case it wasn't. **Similarly, they offer Ants on a Log for dessert. The ingredients are listed as celery, peanut butter and raisins. The same ones used when your mom made it for you. And the price is $10. I didn't order it, so I'm not sure if there is some peanut butter powder with a celery foam and frozen raisin sorbet or what, but if not this might be an elaborate joke being played on the diners of Brooklyn.
13322	414	4.0	1	2013-02-19	"Went on Friday night.  Ambiance is ""cool"" - super hip restaurant, very ""Brooklyn"" with a soundtrack of hip-hop in the background, which I appreciated.  The food was good - but I don't get the fuss.  It didn't blow me away, the portions were ""ok"" and some of it just wasn't great.  I had the pasta which actually was very good - but it's no Al Di La.  The service was fine.  Cash only which is annoying.   Now I'd definitely come back.  I'm told the cocktails are good as are the small plates, neither of  which I tried... and they have the most delightful backyard!  You can roast marshmallows in the back over the fire.  That gets them an additional star."
13323	414	5.0	1	2013-02-12	Vegetarian Review: Yum!!! Cheese: one washed rind cheese paired with chunky hot sauce and one very mild farmer's type cheese paired with agave-macerated green strawberries. Served with delicious spelt bread. Always love Chef Angelo's cheese plates: attests to his ability to source perfect ingredients. Greens: Various dark greens with spicy pickled peppers served with an egg yolk dressing. Very tasty! Vegetables:  Small sweet potatoes baked(?) whole and then served with kefir lime sour cream and pistachios. Simple but so good. Protein: Impossibly fluffy scrambled eggs with black truffle. I can't explain how incredibly tasty these eggs were. My favorite dish. Pasta: Pici with chard and a smoky tomato sauce.  Honestly, by the time this came out, I was already stuffed. Angelo's pici is the star of the pasta world. Hand-rolled, long with a nice bite! Dessert: I am a sadist for ordering dessert, but I couldn't resist the ants on a log: candied celery strips and celery juice dressed the plate, bits of peanut butter crumbs and gelato with raisin cake. MMMMMMMmmmmmm. Wine: We enjoyed a Spanish Rose at the staff's suggestion. The rest of the wine list is really great with lots of natural wine choices. This is a good place to try something new, because Angelo who curates the wine has an excellent palate.
13324	414	4.0	1	2013-02-08	Wonderful.  We visited on a cold night and the two heaters in the front windows did little to help, but with scarves wrapped around our necks and hats on, we had an amazing meal. The bead: 3 different kinds, all amazing and well worth the order, with caraway butter! The olives: delicious, spicy peppers added a great deal.  Downside: too many of the same olive (just one variety) and the radishes were dry and bland The meat and cheese plates: amazing The Sweet Potatoes: not my favorite, but good (it's just a potato with sour cream) The Green Salad: amazing! Very, very good and the peppers were flavorful and spicy. The Fish: the polenta was the best part; the fish was prepared very well, it just didn't stand out The Steak: amazing, although the mushrooms were pretty bland The oxtail stuffed pasta: killer, killer good; hand made obviously The Dessert: completely forgettable.  Something like a cold cake on a crumb base with orange jello and super, super, super, super salty caramel.  It lacked the composition that most all other dishes had and was too frozen to taste like anything anyhow Delicious, a little over priced, overall just a treat.  The bathroom has cloth walls and a ceramic, insulated powerline bulb in it.  The patio looks great, and has a firepit that wasn't going when we visited.  The food was killer, service was great!
13325	414	4.0	1	2013-02-07	LOVE this place. came here for brunch and left VERY happy about the food i ingested (and there was a lot of it!) an ever changing menu... seasonal and delicious. i didnt get around to reviewing this place and its been weeks so i cant be super accurate but i remember everything i ate was fantastic. it involved: smoked fish in a crepe, a homemade chorizo dish, a side of char no.4 bacon, tasty french press coffee. i definitely need to come back! the wait staff was friendly, the place is decorated well (uber brooklyn), and everything was satisfying.
13326	414	4.0	1	2013-01-28	This place is a Grizzly Bear album in the form of a restaurant. The cash-only weathered wood look with the hoighty toighty cocktails and a short menu that covers all the New American bases just right. Bread is an item on the menu and it's $5. When I first saw this my fake mustache almost fell into my brandy from indignation but let me tell you something about the bread here. It's almost a meal in and of itself and I've never smashed down a platter of bread and butter faster than the four giant, warm, fragrant and crispy chunks of carby goodness they brought out with a huge side of fresh herb butter. If you pair this up with salumi and some olives you've got yourself a meal. Other bits: Cured olives - Pretty big bowl and not overly cloying like the briney olives you might be used to. Salumi - Decent portion for two and definitely worth ordering. It was a small plates night for us so we didn't have any of the entrees but I will be coming back for one of those.
13327	414	4.0	1	2013-01-27	The Pines does two things really well: cocktails and giving you a block of butter to go with your small plates. While the cocktail menu is limited, they are interesting and strong. I went with their Baked Apple - bourbon, cider and smoke. That's right, they put smoke in the glass before pouring the drink in. It strangely adds an interesting experience when sipping on your cocktail. Neither of us were starving so we went with three of their small plates - cured olives, bread and salumi. The bread consists of several types on a big plate with a huge slab of herbed butter - for those on a low-carb diet, stay away from this. I loved how much butter came with our bread and salumi plate because butter makes everything better. My friend and I kept looking at everyone's plates around us and I like what I saw so I'll definitely be back for dinner and/or brunch! The place is small with an outdoor garden in the back. The staff are friendly and have a love for this establishment. The way the guy talked about their Ants on a Log dessert was endearing, he was on the verge of drooling. While 3rd Ave might seem like a trek, it's only a couple blocks away from the Union St station on the R so no excuses, just go. But note that this is a CASH ONLY spot.
13328	414	2.0	1	2013-01-26	I really wanted to like this place, but it fell short. This place isn't on par with Roberta's. I don't know how they managed this, but the pork shoulder and duck breast had an identical consistency. The pork shoulder was good but not fantastic. The duck breast was pretty good. The best part of our meal was the amuse-bouche and the bread (which is incredible). Overall I was disappointed and feel that we overpaid for the quality of food. The wine selection is pretty good. Supposedly the cocktails are great, but I didn't have any...probably should have.
13329	414	1.0	1	2013-01-26	Was super excited to check out The Pines. Happened to get right in on a snowy night. The good : cocktails. anything they made was great, but the menu was a bit over the top. ordering a solid cocktail was the way to go. The bad : No olives, dont expect a martini. The service. So awkward and in a way pushy to order. The food menu was strange and lackluster. A cheese plate with one cheese, a meat plate with a giant hunk of butter. This place blasts sort of raunchy hip hop that really does not fit in with the 'anthropologie' style of the entire. All around too bad.
13330	414	5.0	1	2013-01-14	The shit.
13331	414	5.0	1	2013-01-07	"As I walked over to 3rd Ave, I mentioned that The Pines had hit-or-miss reviews on Yelp.  To which she replied, ""and you'll be adding to that list.""  Oh, so correct, that one.   Hit.  Excellent cocktail.  Tasty starters--don't you dare take away the unfinished apples! That shit will cleanse my palate later!  The crudo didn't need the beef fat, but shhhhh, don't tell anyone.  Tilefish was a revelation--and the dish didn't actually need the tilefish, the accompaniments were so delish (wheatberries, rutabaga and cranberry? I don't recall--it was so good, I barely ate my delish fish).  Cray, right? The crowd was a cross of hipsters, daters and P.Slopers in pearls.  The noise level was loud and the room was HAWT (including ""it's getting hot in here"" on the sound system).   I loved it.  It was a hit.  I'll be back.  I heart 3rd Ave."
13332	414	1.0	1	2012-12-18	"First time here. I don't think they put 5k into the place when they renovated. Drinks and wine list are good! Though the baked apple will make people at the other table cough. Our amuse was a single garbanzo bean. A single bean. Thanks for the spoon and the cobwebs on the light fixtures. You pay for the bread, that's fancy. They let you know ahead of time the kitchen sends out food when it's ready. So timing and coordination in this place is not practiced. You could be done with your first sharing plate and 1 min later the next comes then while you're still working on your 2nd the 3rd comes and when you finish that there will be a 20 min gap until entrees. So basically when they get around to it they'll fire your food and every ticket is As it Comes. Had Testa which they told me was a terrine and what we got was slivers of pig brain. $14 wow great value for thinly sliced ""terrine"". Sweet potato, ehhh! Bay scallops was a rip for $28. So was the pasta garganelli. Anyone with a little effort could make that dish at home. You don't have to take a trip and pay $18. Pork shoulder diced  and spread out on a plate with a sauce that nothing special and  rye berries. Looked like presentation meant lets just randomly spread it out on a plate. Artsy! My steak was good! Quality and cooked perfect without asking me. This place sucked though, saw some celebrity there I didn't know. It's a place for morons and clowns who can't cook and visit the website Eater daily along with  never had a quality meal especially at home to go out and be impressed with a restaurant who cares little about decor or presentation on the plate. They try very hard to create new flavors like mix lime zest with loaded sweet potato. Just steak and some maitake , sliced and about  6oz worth at best was for $34. I really don't know what the big deal is about this place. You will leave here trying to figure out why are they trying so hard to impress you with flavors that don't work ?Why is it such a dump? Why did I pay so much for something not worth it? Why am I still hungry??? We passed on desserts, what would've been the point really?"
13333	414	3.0	1	2012-12-17	Charming setup and our service was helpful and friendly but definitely overpriced relative to location and quality of the food & drinks.
13334	414	2.0	1	2012-12-16	I'd give it 4 stars for decor, its the food they need to work on. Brunch started inauspiciously when we were told they were out of bacon. The coffee situation-- single-cup, double- or large-size French press containers only-- struck me as a petty extra expense and overly restrictive. The digital timers they put on the coffee carafes, while a delightful refinement in theory, forced us to listen to them detonating periodically all around the restaurant. My mushroom, egg, potato, cheese dish was just that-- a series of ingredients in a bowl, neither terrible nor particularly good. More dramatic was the side sausage. My first bite practically conjured the animal and its enclosure right there at the table with its unnerving gaminess. Others pronounced the bluefish waffle dry and the carbonara undistinguished. With the bill coming to $35/person (including tip) for our table, I'd say brunch here is an eminently skippable experience. addendum: I guess brunch just started here so perhaps they are still ironing out the creases...
13335	414	5.0	1	2012-12-10	I went to The Pines yesterday, pleasantly surprised that they had started brunch service earlier this month. We were seated right away. Loved the ambiance, and every staff member was professional and courteous. The food? Delicious. Starting with the french-pressed coffee (you get your own little press at the table that beeps when it's ready to pour) and amazing bread, the entire meal was a solid five stars. Seriously, their carraway brioche was so good that I wish I could have a bit with my coffee at work each morning. I sipped on a grimosa (grapefruit and champagne), while the beau drank a bloody mary. For those of you that want to drink a bloody mary instead of eating it, get it here: they have the essence of horseradish without those little pieces floating in it. Clear, really refreshing. Our entrees were delicious as well: the mushroom hash had a nice spicy kick to it, and the apples were light and fresh with sheeps milk yogurt and house-made granola. I can't speak for the carnivores in my party, but their satisfied faces and pats on the belly afterwards made it clear that the chorizo and fried egg were equally tasty. It's a little pricey (and it's cash only), but I didn't have that sense of regret I sometimes have when I feel I spent too much on food that comes up short. The Pines doesn't come up short in any aspect. As we were leaving, we took a peek at the spacious backyard and found out they make s'mores when the weather is nicer, so in case we weren't going to make a return trip, that sealed the deal.
13336	414	2.0	1	2012-12-08	"This place is exactly like it's brother/sister Littleneck: Great on ambiance and vibe, but awful in service and mediocre in content. Saturday night no wait. We never got the amuse-bouche everyone else seemed to be having. The bread was nice and warm --the best thing of the night, unfortunately. I made several attempts to see if the chef would serve the wagyu or the pork well done since I'm pregnant, however he refused since he ""liked to present it his way"" according to the waitress. Listen, I'm a foodie, I know you eat wagyu medium rare, the tuna seared, etc, but would be too much to ask if he could as a favor leave it in the pan for just a bit longer? It' s not like one single dish will spoil his ""work of art"". Anyway, ordered the Green salad which was incredibly spicy, inedible for me. The Garganelli were hand made (at least) but AFTER we ordered they come back saying they had run out of mussels and were replacing it with some other seafood. Not only did it not have mussels, but they didn't add any other seafood and served it anyway. Hum. The wine for my husband never came and it was charged regardless. No apologies from waitstaff. The truth, it's the same problem they have with Littleneck, which really has little to offer other than the vibe (meaning decor and music, mainly). Although I am a huge supporter of the Brooklyn food scene -especially in Gowanus since I live so close by- I don't think this place is or will be all it promised."
13337	414	4.0	1	2012-12-03	"An excellent meal; if it was a bit more reasonably priced, I would feel comfortable with a 5 star review.  Unfortunately, unlike their sister-restraurant Littleneck, you are paying for every penny of enjoyment you are getting at The Pines. We were a table for four.  We were greeted by a host who told us there would be a 90 minute wait, but also that we were the next table of the list.  I scanned the room and saw people halfway through their entrees--I said, ""you think those people will be there for another hour and a half?""  He said, ""well, I was just being conservative.""  One drink at Canal Bar and 45 minutes later, we were seated.   The Room: I love the ambiance of this place.  It has a great vibe and the seating choices are excellent.  Also, the backyard looks amazing for when it gets warm.  Definitely a great date spot.   The Drinks: 14 dollars for cocktails is pretty annoying, even if they are excellent.  14 dollars for a cocktail that I could finish in 3-5 sips, sucks even more.  The cocktails are beautifully presented, but should be 11 dollars.   The Food: We had the Apples (really great), the greens (should be more in the serving--ordered two of them), and the sweet potato (a knockout) to start.  I think the appetizers were all great, the apple and sweet potato were 5 star dishes, the greens probably a 3.5.   For entrees, we shared the streak and tileflish, and I loved both.  The steak was prepared perfectly and the titlefish was also delicious. We had dessert as well, but it was not particularly memorable.   Overall, I really liked the Pines.  But if I am choosing between Littleneck and the Pines in the future, I will likely return to Littleneck first because there is a lot more bang for your buck."
12548	414	5.0	1	2012-12-03	"Sunday night at 6:30 pm.  That's when we walked to The Pines because they don't take reservations for parties under six people and we really really wanted to try the food at The Pines.  We were not disappointed. We started with the La Quercia prosciutto.  Ahhh... buttery good and tasty.  And if it wasn't buttery enough, butter on the plate to slather on the rustic bread that accompanied the meat. Do you like bone marrow?  Then try the dish served up at The Pines.  Soft juicy and scraped from the bone, it was flavorful and wonderful. Pasta called ""pici"" served al dente and with ""trotter"" which from the taste was a rich gamey pork.  Covered in tomato and pecorino cheese. Wow was this dish great! Wine by the glass is very well priced, I had a grenache/carignan combination that was only $12 the glass.  the waitperson warned me that it had ""barnyard"" flavors and offered me a taste first.  I didn't tell her that I knew the taste well, but I was really bowled over by how well it brought out the pig in the pici.  A definite score. Prices are not moderate, but also will not kill your wallet.  A definite five star restaurant."
13338	414	5.0	1	2012-12-03	I stumbled into The Pines this past Saturday night when our original dinner plans fell through. WOW. I had never heard of this place and from start to finish it blew me away. When we first arrived, I was quite skeptical. They apparently reserved .1% of their budget for the decor of this place. It was raw and rustic and honestly, slightly dingy. I assumed the dinner was going to be terrible OR that they put the remaining 99.9% of their budget into their food and it was going to be amazing. Thank goodness it was the latter of the two. We started off with the greens. In my opinion, this was the best of the three dishes we tried because it was the most unique combination of flavors I have had. We moved on to the cheese, which was a bit of a letdown but also a poor decision on our part to order as this is something you can buy directly from a supermarket. The bread they served with it, however, was homemade and drizzled in honey so it really complimented the cheese. We finished our meal with the wagyu beef and it was cooked to perfection! The tomato puree sauce was delightful as well. Bottom line, this place catered to my love of food as well as my adventurous side. I had not heard of half of the ingredients on the menu but I was happily surprised by them all. In addition, any place that serves cucumber infused water, plays Frank Ocean and Kanye with candlelit tables, and makes one of the best Manhattan's in the city is approved in my book.
13339	414	5.0	1	2012-11-30	Though I haven't had a chance to eat here yet, I already love this place as a hangout. Delicious, unique cocktails and a great beer selection to enjoy while taking in the great rustic atmosphere of this spectacular new bar. Definitely try this place out! Bonus point for fire pit and free s'mores out back! Hope they keep the back patio open all year!
13340	414	3.0	1	2012-11-29	WAY too expensive for the amount of  food. I'm not some glutinous American either but it was just shameful for that area. On the other hand, it was very delicious! The interior was really cool, great wines, and amazing cheese appetizer. I got the oxtail entree which was great. My husband got the pork shoulder aka 5 bite sized pieces of fat which was pretty disappointing. It may be difficult to get him to go back for a second try but I thought the quality and pairings of food was interesting. Sadly not the prices:( OH and the menu is the horribly designed, please straiten out the content so people can actually understand what goes with what... apparently the two tables who sat next to us also agree with me on this.
11177	414	4.0	1	2012-11-24	A nice weekday place in the neighborhood. The chef is trying hard to find new flavor/texture combos, which is commendable... though portions and plating were all over the map every time I went. The testa with pumpkin bread was unexpected but great. Also enjoyed the short ribs and the beer and wine selections were solid. Not exactly a destination (and a little heavy on the extra-loud rap music to make it a date spot), but I'll be back for sure.
13341	414	4.0	1	2012-11-24	A needle in a haystack!  This is from the same guys that opened Littleneck down the block, and is a needed addition to the neighborhood. The Pines is the closest to contemporary fine dining you can get in the Gowanus/Park Slope neighborhood.  We went here on an off-night (maybe a Tuesday) with a brunch of friends, and were immediately accomodated.  We decided to go family style, ordering a bunch of dishes. As we ordered a variety of dishes, I will just go with the hits.  The amuse-bouche was refreshing.  The bread was awesome.  Nicely crusty, and the salty butter was off the chain.  The oxtail cappellacci is a can't-miss.  Pasta was cooked to perfection, and the oxtail was divine.  The pork shoulder was also very tasty Overall, a much-needed restaurant in this part of town, and I will definitely be coming back.
13342	414	2.0	1	2012-11-23	Time for a reality check friends.  I admire the ambition but please keep in mind that you are not in Manhattan and 80s nouvelle cuisine is over.  A glass of wine should have a lot of wine in it.  Two flowers on a spoon do not an amuse bouche make.  And four tortellone do not make a meal.  The food is good but the presentation is über precious.  This is Gowanus Brooklyn and we want to EAT and DRINK.  We do, sort of, next door at Littleneck.  Next time, please feed me, OK?
9603	414	3.0	1	2012-11-18	The Pines is a perfectly serviceable Brooklyn-style restaurant with excellent pastas. This is not the kind of restaurant where you need to save up your precious pennies to go full-out on all three courses. Just come here for a casual serving of pasta--anything on the menu will do, although the pici truly wowed--and you'll leave happy.
13343	414	4.0	1	2012-11-17	I'm giving four stars here, but I think there are moments that could be five and others that could be three. Allow me to clarify. I have eaten at the Pines a few times now and I can honestly say that when all of the elements in any given dish (the menu changes almost nightly, with the exception of a few steadies) completely harmonize, it is as compelling and flavorful as anything I've ever had in this type of cuisine. I gladly forgive any missteps because of the creativity and the quality of ingredients. Add some excellent funky wine, great draft beer or one of their highly crafted cocktails to the mix and you're in for one hell of a meal. There's a trick to ordering and enjoying the menu... Get one or two of everything and share. I've found that it makes for an exciting and revelatory experience that is satisfying as well. It's not cheap, but when you've gone that route it justifies the bill. If there is anything that could tighten up a bit is the service. Not bad, but not running like clockwork yet. I feel that it is a minor symptom of being such a new place. When you combine the excellence of the food, the booze options, the rustic kitsch of the decor, the music and the back yard, this place rates a solid four stars... I might bump it up to five after my next meal, which will be soon. They have a loyal customer in me.
9662	414	4.0	1	2012-11-12	"There are literally an infinite number of food combinations that can be made. From ingredients, to preparation, to plating, everything can change. It's a reason I don't eat out as much as I used to... there are a lot of places that keep doing the same old, same old. It's true that there's a reason why the classics are the classics. Lord knows that I've gotten more tacos than are actually needed, but I love that places like The Pines exist to explore new and different food combinations. Right off the bat, the Oxtail Cappellacci w/ crab brodo, buddha's hand, chickweed is one of the best things I've ever eaten. The pasta was tender and perfectly cooked, the oxtail exploded with creamy flavor, and the brodo (italian for broth I found out) was a great compliment. Totally amazing dish. I recommend it to anybody. The Pork Shoulder w/ rye berry, kohlrabi, quince was good, but the flavors didn't hit a home run. While the pork was cooked nicely, I kept hoping everything would sort of become extraordinary in my mouth, and it didn't. On a kind of similar note, I liked the Yam w/ buttermilk, sardine, brussel sprouts, but it wasn't amazing. The buttermilk was creamy and nice with the yam. And while I really like brussel sprouts, they were just sort of ""there"" rather than a part of the dish. They tasted good though. I had read about the Apples w/ sheep's milk, sesame, som, and was excited to try it. Most of the time when I think about eating apples, textures like ""crisp"" and ""juicy"" come to mind. But this dish would best be described as ""creamy crunchy"". It was a good combination with subtle flavors. Normally, I'm not a big fan of olives, but it tasted like they cured them in house, which is great. The dried peppers, radish, white balsamic also totally worked, and I think I ate more olives at that meal than I have at any other. The juice was so good that I dipped other stuff in it. And speaking of bread, what they served was fine, if a little bit too crusty for my taste. But holy moly, the caraway butter was fantastic. And putting it on rye bread was like mana from heaven. The Jicama w/ coconut, pancetta, sea beans was pretty good too. To be honest, I don't eat a lot of jicama, so I don't have a lot to compare it too, but it was a bit crunchy and refreshing. One of my friends commented that he enjoyed eating nice food in more humble establishments like this, because it takes a lot of the pretense out of the meal. I had to agree. I like fancy schmancy restaurants, but places like this will hopefully prove that the white table cloths aren't necessary. If I had one big complaint though, it was the service. They didn't seem to remember that I had made a reservation about a month prior. It luckily didn't matter, since we arrived pretty early, but it could have been an issue. I was also not informed that groups six and larger all eat from essentially the same tasting menu, because of their small kitchen. We didn't have a problem with this, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time. It also said on the menu that they enjoy making substitutions to meals, which struck me as really interesting, and the opposite from what most places are like. And being that we had one person in our group who was a pescetarian, and another who didn't eat dairy or gluten, they certainly got their wish. Lastly, let's talk about cocktails, because they had some great ones. The all-star, in my opinion, was the Baked Apple. You get a brandy snifter that's filled with smoke, and has a small, metal plate on top of it to trap the smoke. The waiter then removes the plate, letting the smoke escape, and pours in a wonderful combination of bourbon, scotch, honey crisp apple, maple bitters, and fall herbs. It was smoky, sweet and packed a punch. Their eponymous drink was also very good. Rye, douglas fir, bitters, yuzu. Like the food, not ingredients that you would normally put together, but a good drink. I also got a Verano Cesar, which has tequila, hibiscus, cucumber, lime, soda. It was light, refreshing, and didn't overpower you with tequila. My friend, who doesn't like tequila tried it and liked it so much, she got her own. That's the sign of a well thought out drink. They also had High West Double Rye on their shelf, and I asked if the bartender could make me a Manhattan with it. They did, but I was informed that they don't have cherries, but would make a substitution. I'm not sure what they put in its place (maybe gooseberry?) but it worked, and I was happy."
13344	414	5.0	1	2012-11-07	It's as if the chef of The Pines went on an Italian joyride with Lil Wayne, Jackson Pollock, and a bunch of local burly Italian chefs and they all did head stands and drank excessive amounts of Hennessy and tripped on shots of pork infused seafood butter and deep earth funk and they heard the earth whisper her secrets and Angelo was the only one who made it out. Once you see the platings and taste the food for yourself, you'll understand. The chef, Angelo Romano, is doing something very true to the ingredients but completely unique and from his own school of thought. Very fun, surprising, and delicious. The menu reads deceptively simple, but behind the scenes the art of cooking is absolutely complex. The understanding of hitting all the flavor notes is incredible, the tastes are all sublimely constructed. Some faves: Oxtail agnolotti in crab brodo, the apples in sheepsmilk, the mussels & pasta, the steak, the japanese grilled half lobster... really, EVERYthing... didn't have a miss, and we tasted the whole menu. I especially recommend all the handmade pastas and any course with shellfish. Hands Down, Top 5 Restaurants to open in 2012. It's a little pricey, but I can't say enough good things about The Pines, it's crazy good. 5 STARS
13345	414	3.0	1	2012-11-04	"It pains me a little bit to give the Pines 3 stars.  I adore its older seester Littleneck, and I was so excited to give this landlubber sibling a try.  It just did not come close to what we were expecting and left us with a decent, but sadly not a very memorable meal. We got there on a weekend evening around 9 and there was a 40 minute wait.  No big deal, went to Canal Bar for a drink and the Pines staff nicely called within half and hour.  Interior of the restaurant is purposefully shabby rustic, with an antiquey feel throughout.  A few bottles of wine and one of the appetizers were no longer available - ok on the appetizer, but perhaps the wine shortage can be avoided by keeping more in stock, especially on a weekend evening? Started off fun, got the amuse bouche while Biggie's ""Juicy"" was playing.  Orange wedge over a tofu cream, refreshing.  Then we started with the bone marrow appetizer, which is topped with tobiko and chickweed, and served with olive bread.  Olive bread was torn by hand, warm and deliciously crusty.  Scooping the bone marrow on to the bread, it was a nice dish.  I liked the tobiko addition texturally, had no idea why the chickweed was on top as it seemed like a hinderance on the dish to be pushed aside to get to the marrow.  Large bone, not so much marrow, but tasty.   Seemed to need some salt or something to bring out the marrow.   Next, the much touted pici, thick strands of pasta with trotter ragu.  Decent dish, nothing revelatory, simple but a little doughy.  Tiny pieces of pork were tasty but scarce.   Main dishes were decent, especially the skirt steak - beautifully sliced and presented, tasty with beefy flavor.  However, the evening was soured by the pork shoulder dish which was truly a little odd on the palate.  Some of the pieces were very fatty and chewy (not in a good way) and the nduja (a spicy spreadable sausage saucey residue - and lots of it) was really offputting.  Had a cornmeal texture which did not go well with the pork and its spice overwhelmed the delicate pork.  I really think the Pines should rethink this dish, as we love spicy dishes and pork, and especially spicy pork dishes, but this one fell flat.  We did not have dessert which is a choice of gelatos. For the prices the Pines is charging, there needs to be more than a loud soundtrack, beavis and butthead scrawled on a menu, and random ingredients thrown in because they sound exotic.   Things need to come togerher so that a restaurant sticks around past the hype.  Overall, I'd like to give the Pines another shot as its success will be integral to Gowanus' culinary boom, but the night we went was not its night.  Cash only."
13346	414	4.0	1	2012-11-03	Really 3.5 but I'm feeling generous. Most of the savory stuff was quite good, if a bit pricey. ($24 for a small bowl of agnolotti and $15 for bone marrow seemed a bit steep). The service was very friendly and the draft beers fantastic. My main problem is with the desserts, especially the pumpkin/quince/lavender gelato that just tasted way too floral/soapy. The small cookie on it was nice, but it was pretty much just a small scoop of mediocre ice cream on top of a smear of quince spread. And it's hard to quibble with the freebies, but the amuse of tangerine and soft tofu and salt was pretty blah. Maybe wait until January when citrus tastes better? And the soda intermezzo was flat. But, back to the positives, great job on the tile fish! Nice crunchy skin and yummy sauce.The skirt steak was decent, if a bit chewy/sinewy, and we all loved the chicory/bacon salad. The agnolotti in crab broth was fantastic. Anyway, keep up the good effort! With some tweaks I'm sure it can be great. I'm sure the chefs and small kitchen staff are quite busy with all the savory stuff and the minor problems will get ironed out soon enough.
13347	414	5.0	1	2012-10-30	holy moly, this place is freaking delicious and service is great! short rib was good and rich garganelli with mussels and burrata is heavenly and comforting. chef is particularly awesome: Sweet crab smell wafted from the kitchen and I asked our bartender if I could have whatever dish the crab was in. He notified me that the chef was preparing crab for the next night's dinner special. So I opted for the garnganelli. Then during the middle of dinner, the chef presented a bowl of pasta with the crab sauce he was preparing for the next night! How cool is that!
11195	414	2.0	1	2012-10-29	"As Johnny Rotten once famously said...""Ever get the feeling you've been cheated""...""New Brooklyn"" at its pretentious, self-satisfied worst, starting with the smug rude servers with attitude to the point you are practically driven to smack them.  Perhaps I should have expected this considering the management was involved with the short lived (for good reason in my book) Masten Lake in Williamsburg.   Much like my experiences there, I found a good amount of the food here, like a bewildering burrata that was an overload of random flavors yet somehow registered as nothingness, and a weird sweet potato dish that may have been the most overwhelmingly starchy thing I've ever tasted, to be a muddled mess of ingredients that the chefs obviously thought were high minded creative masterpieces.  They so weren't.  Other stuff was merely unmemorable in any way, like the fish and the cocktails, which despite bearing no discernible distinctions from the typical ones offered at most any random newish spot in BK were priced a few bucks more a piece across the board.  The one area the place did succeed in was the pasta course, both the Pici, a thick oversized bucatini type pasta with a trotter ragu, and the ravioli stuffed with pork neck or something like that served with a few muscles were perfectly cooked and extremely tasty.  That was not nearly enough to offset the shock when the bill came and somehow wound up being at least 60 dollars more than I would have anticipated.    Adding insult to injury,  the place is cash only, making it one of the biggest rip-offs currently going in the borough.  Also the blaring Drake-Chris Brown heavy soundtrack  was one of the most Obnoxious I have encountered, particularly in NYC."
13348	414	5.0	1	2012-10-22	"Had one of the best meals I have had in a while here... The house made testa with filone, huckleberry,celery, black pepper was really good Apples with sheep's milk, sesame, hibiscus was so refreshing! I am not an apple person but this made me love apples... Sweet potato with buttermilk, hearts of palm and fried anchovies was killer... Oxtail cappellacci with crab brodo, nasturtium, buddha's hand...The broth...Omigod the friggin broth...So rich and so flavorful! The pouches of pasta were packed with flavor...Very nice dish! Pici with trotter ragu was very interesting...Reminded me of the ""Ragu of Odd Things"" from Commerce in NYC...Love that barnyardy flavor from the trotter! The pasta had that slight gummy texture I enjoy from fresh pastas...Just know that this dish is on the heavier side, due to the density of the pasta... Sweetbreads, nduja, compressed tangarines...Holy crap, this dish blew my mind...So good! The texture of the batter on the sweetbreads was so light and crispy...The compressed tangerines were so fragrant and delightful! Dry aged skirt steak with treviso, charred baby leeks and potatoes cooked in beef fat and sriracha...Super beefy flavor! The potatoes were killer! Really enjoyed this dish! The service was also really good...Not to in your face and very relaxed! Really enjoyed the decor and the music...Make sure to check out the garden in the back! Very cozy and inviting! Check this place out ya'll..."
13349	414	5.0	1	2012-10-14	LOVED IT. Everything was ridiculously fresh and the dishes were complex and interesting. My oxtail pasta was incredible, though I do wish the portion was a big larger. Will be back soon for sure.
13350	414	4.0	1	2012-09-30	"My group of three were invited to the Grand Opening of this lovely little restaurant last week.  I am not from NYC, so I really had no idea where I was going, only that it promised to be interesting. WOW!  I was pleasantly surprised.  I felt the restaurant and the food were very sophisticated and very ""top chef"" for the neighborhood.  It was later that I found out that Brooklyn is now becoming the culinary capital of New York City.  If that is true, than The Pines is in the running for one of the best. We were all blown away by our starters, good sized portions, inventive and delicious.  Nothing I would ever find on this little rock of mine in the middle of the sea.  The bread we were served was so good with the handmade caraway butter that it disappeared in minutes and all three of us don't really eat carbs! We were disappointed to find that the lasagna was sold out, but that must have been a testament to how good it was. Two of us had the roast chicken and one person had the short ribs.  Both dishes were delicious and felt as if they were prepared with care and perfection even though the place was packed and I'm sure they were sweating it out in the kitchen. Our dessert was simple and delicious, a perfect ending to a perfect meal.  We had homemade sorbet and ice cream. I would recommend that anyone looking for the new hot place to eat in Brooklyn should give The Pines a try.  It was great! The reason for four stars and not five is simple -  everything on the opening night menu had pork in it.  Now, I love a high end piece of bacon as much as the next person, but my husband's ancestors don't like him eating the pig.  More pig-free choices are a good thing."
13351	414	5.0	1	2012-09-24	What an amazing experience! The food is incredibly fresh, innovative and delicious. We were given a celery granita to begin, to cleanse our palates. It was so delicious and very fresh. We then shared the cheese plate (LOVE the tomato mustarda, and the cheese was lovely and so creamy), then the breads with house made caraway butter with sea salt-amazing! The lettuce salad was flavorful and tasty, For my entree (yes, I was STILL eating) I had the pork chop. I have literally never tasted a more tender and juicy piece of pork in my life.  I think I had a dream about it last night. I also want to mention the incredibly helpful staff. The service was superb. The decor is kitschy and cozy- it was the absolutely perfect spot for a rainy evening. I had a peek at the garden and I know it's the kind of place that will draw crowds near and far. I am so happy to have The Pines so close by- I will definitely be back!
13352	414	5.0	1	2012-09-23	Went here yesterday with a friend for dinner. It's a cute, cozy place with salvaged wood, signs and assorted artifacts that is both charming and very BK. They also have a garden with outdoor seating. Service is excellent, and food was amazing. We ordered most of what was on the menu (no joke) and everything was equally delicious. They should sell the tomato mustarda and caraway butter on the side cos I can't be the only one who would buy it...Wait, did I mention that garden? Love the garden. Love it. Wanna marry it. Hope it's single.
13353	68	1.0	-1	2012-10-05	Rude, slow service waste of time do go there. been there 3 times always the same.
13354	68	2.0	-1	2013-02-10	I really liked the pizza it was pretty amazing. But PLEASE DO NOT EAT THERE GET TAKE OUT. They have terrible service. It was awful. I sit down with a group of eight friends to eat. The waitress seemed like she was in a rush the whole time taking our drink orders. She goes around to everyone and asks them what they want to drink. She forgets me, so I thought it was just a mistake, but when I asked her to make sure that I got a water too I got a very quick sassy answer it almost seemed like she was on drugs. Then it got even more uncomfortable when the waitress and another waitress would not stop staring at our table, and me. It was just an awful dining experience in general and I recommend no one eat there. But the pizza is great so get take out or delivery.
13355	68	2.0	-1	2013-01-25	Their food is too expensive for what you get. I ordered 30 wings for $20+ and it was like a snack for 1 person.  I had people over and they all commented on the size ... it was embarrassing.
13356	68	2.0	-1	2012-12-16	Tried to convince my girlfriend that Palermo's had better pizza than piccolos down the street. After months of talking up the tomato pie that palermos has we finally decided to get one. The pizza was barely warm, dried out and tasted like it had been siiting out for a few hours. Normally i love their tomato pie but tonight they let me down and it breaks my heart. It will take much convincing to get my girlfreind to try it again but I am not sure that i want to anymore. : (
13357	68	3.0	-1	2014-02-05	We order the tomato pie when we patronize this restaurant.  It hearkens back to a Chambersburg tomato pie.  Not of the standard of DeLorenzo's but it is very good.  The service was attentive.  Parking at Palermo's of Ewing is a problem when they are busy.
13358	68	5.0	-1	2014-10-29	Owner is very friendly, staff is polite, and is very accommodating.  Great food, and excellent service. Barry and Vince are great!
13359	68	5.0	-1	2011-11-20	Overall great good. Quick delivery. Hot food was hot, cold food was cold, and it was yummy.   I wish they'd not chintz on butter...I had 2 bread rolls and one baked potato and only got 2 tiny butter packets and no salt. But, I'd order again, the good was good and staff was courteous.
8477	68	4.0	1	2015-01-03	We came on a Saturday night for takeout, we were the only one here. Everything we ordered was great. The steak special was delicious and the chicken scampi is amazing. Everything is well worth the price we paid for. Will def come back again!
8468	68	4.0	1	2014-12-03	This has been our go-to place for delivery and take out for the past 2 years. We are loyal to a fault without trying any other pizza joint in the area. Super fast delivery and everything is always hot and fresh. The only thing we have not re-order are the wings which are tiny and practically meatless. More recently the bottom of the pizza has been consistently charred and we have been a little disappointed. Not ready to move on to a new place yet; Palermo's strong!
13360	68	5.0	1	2014-11-25	Great family celebration at Palermos III.  Every said the food was great.  Staff made everyone comfortable.  We will return.
13361	68	3.0	1	2014-10-02	Inconsistent. Pizza used to be very good on a consistent basis but has been up and down for awhile now. Toppings taste canned. Will stick with them but hope they get back to what made them the best pizza in Ewing.
13362	68	4.0	1	2014-09-19	BEST TOMATO SAWCE!!! I had the Eggplant Parmesan and it was BOMB. They slice it pretty thin, cover it in red sauce, mozz cheese and more of the delicious red sauce over it, side of pasta, soup or salad. $15 not bad at all. My husband had the meatball sandwich, I tried a bite, it's not my fave. The server seemed like it was his first day on the job, but we all had to start somewhere ;-) First time in NJ for me and it wasnt a bad place to start for good eats in the east. Compliments to the mom/pop who decided to make their kitchen a reality for Jersey noobs like myself.
13363	68	5.0	1	2014-07-13	Ordered a boat load of yummy food for takeout on a Sunday night with my fiance and couldn't be more pleased! We passed Palermo's for over two years always taking a mental note to stop in but we never did. I can most certainly say that we will order from here time and time again. We had the mussels in white sauce, cavatelli with meat sauce and the vodka rigatoni and we were completely satisfied. Great, fast service and delicious food! Cannot wait to eat at Palermo's III again!
13067	68	4.0	1	2014-04-10	Never stray from pizza here and you're golden. We have a kid so we can't go out drinking Friday nights anymore, but we CAN go to Palermos and I CAN house a bottle of wine with some bangin' pizza. (Do people still say bangin'? Doubtful, but this pizza's still really good.) Palermo's beats DeLorenzo's by a long shot for tomato pies. (Shut up. I don't wanna here it. Local institution or not, DeLorenzo's sucks.) The soups we've had here have been decent, too, but the entrees are oh god, absolutely awful. Worst Chicken Marsala. Ever. For $18, you'll get a couple of overcooked, dry chicken breasts swimming in weak sauce with CANNED mushrooms. And a lovely dish of frozen gnocchi with diabetic-coma-inducing marinara sauce. Gross. Just get pizza. Tomato pie, Brooklyn pie, even the cheese pie (we like hot peppers and prosciutto on ours) are all BANGIN'. The waitstaff has always been friendly and prompt.
13364	68	3.0	1	2014-04-10	I've stopped in here only a few times for lunch.  Both times I had to wait an extra long time for my food.  I didn't realize until recently that I had the option to order online.  That would have saved me some time.  But I'm not sure if I'll be going back because the food was merely decent.  I wasn't too excited about the buffalo chicken wrap that I got.  It was rather drenched and difficult to eat, to be severely lacking the flavor it did.  The folks who rang my order up seemed nice enough.  It also appears to be a popular place to get a pizza, as pictures of local celebrities are seen throughout the establishment.
8432	68	1.0	1	2014-03-28	Very rude employees and manager. We ordered takeout 3 times and ate there twice. Unfortunately, 2 out of those 5 times we got a complete attitude from the man behind the counter, who I believe is a manager/owner. We are very quiet, laid back people and there was no need for an attitude for just wanting to know how long until our food would be ready. Our order was wrong so we needed to know (some people do have other things to do, and our night doesn't just revolve around getting mediocre food from your restaurant). There were a couple of other strange, rude encounters. I was excited to find a somewhat decent local place, but we will not be going back. We will be sure to recommend Mama Flora's instead to our friends/neighbors, where the owner is respectable and a decent human being.
13365	68	5.0	1	2014-03-08	Great tomato pie, always ask for it well done, it won't disappoint. The summer pie, vodka rigatoni, and eggplant Parmesan sandwich are my other go tos. The service is always excellent too.
13366	68	5.0	1	2014-02-17	We ended up at Palermo III by default as it was a Sunday evening and our first choice was closed.  Food was very good; and, the service could not have been better.  I am in town from the west coast, visiting family and needed a fix of Trenton tomato pie.  A previous visit allowed me to enjoy the offering at the Rt. 206 location...also great great.
13367	68	4.0	1	2014-01-05	I've tried just about every pizza place in Ewing and this is my favorite.  The tomato pie is thin, crispy, flavorful and delicious.  I've tried some of their other pizzas, but they weren't particularly memorable, so I recommend sticking with the tomato pie.  I've only done takeout, not dine-in, so I can't speak to ambiance but it looks like the place gets crowded in weekends.
13368	68	1.0	1	2013-12-23	This guy has a problem  I called there for delivery and I explained to the girl the last 2 deliv. Was burnt I asked her not to burn it this time , when I get the pizza it is half cooked I called back and the girl put the owner on he was very sarcastic he said for me to bring the pie in and he will cook it all the way I just paid a tip to the deliv. Guy an d it was $15 and change when I get there the owner was in the back of the place looking at me behind the racks then he comes over and called me a f___en as____eand took $12 out of the register and told me to get out  I think I hurt that little guys EGO I told him he needs anger mgmt. and to learn how to cook a pizza he did this while the original pizza was being heated they don't do that off Kinkora rd in Mansfield. Old York rd.          Charlie W.
8482	68	1.0	1	2013-07-07	All of these positive reviews must be for takeout. Went here with a group for dinner. Walking in, I immediately didn't expect much, but I was even more disappointed than I thought I'd be. Here is the rundown: -Poor decor (they didn't even try) -Tablecloth with a huge stain (we had to cover it with a plate) -Glasses with lipstick on them (ew!) -Worst fried mushrooms EVER (I couldn't even tell they were mushrooms) -Slow service -Decent entrees, but why would I want a side of pasta that had a different sauce than my dinner? I will NEVER even consider going here again.
13369	68	3.0	1	2013-07-03	OMG, I am so disappointed. Palermo's in Bordentown is hands down our favorite pizza/ tomato pie anywhere. However, we usually find ourselves here at the Ewing location because its so much closer to home--and it's still an hour away. Ewing has never been as good as Bordentown (which is where the original owner works), but its usually still better than 99% of the pizza in NJ. This weekend unfortunately that changed. We were served a tomato pie with a slightly uncooked crust and cheese that had an off taste to it. I'm not willing to give up on Palermo's just yet though. Next time, we're heading back to Bordentown where I expect (fingers crossed) we will be served the very best pizza in New Jersey.
13370	68	5.0	1	2013-06-11	I was staying nearby on a business trip.  For a quick meal I went to Palermo's.  Fortunately they sell the tomato pies and pizzas by the slice if you don't want to buy a whole pie.  Really delicious pies and the service was friendly and helpful.  Later that week I went back and tried the Chicken Parmesan.  Delicious and plentiful.  I highly recommend  this place.
13371	68	5.0	1	2013-04-26	I'm reviewing the Brooklyn Pie because its literally the only thing that I've ever ordered. It was so good the first time and every time since that I see no reason to stray. The crust is perfectly thin and crisp. Being a square pie, you get a lot of delicious crust crunchiness. The sauce is just sweet enough to play up the tomatoes without becoming cloyingly sugary. The mozzarella cheese is never soggy; I've had some that's resembled a wet sponge. Basil and fresh garlic finish off the pie. The Brooklyn pie is simple. That's exactly why it's so perfect.
13372	68	4.0	1	2013-03-22	TOMATO PIE. that's all you need to know, and all you need to order! DELICIOUS!
13373	68	4.0	1	2013-01-29	We were visiting friends and walked over to this restaurant which is always great to be able to do in NJ. The veal was surprisingly good, actually the best I've had in awhile.Soup and salad was included.Dessert was good(cannoli  and cake).I liked the cappuccino.My only complaint- the booths are a little small.It's BYOB which is a plus.If  I lived within walking distance I'd be a regular!
10119	68	4.0	1	2013-01-06	If you are as lazy as I am on Sunday nights, this is the BEST place to place an order. They have the most awesome online ordering service that includes reviews, approximate delivery time and online credit card payment.  So I guess I should talk about their food too.....lol. I ordered their Potato Skins and was pleasantly surprised with a really different version. They empty out potato halves and stuff them witch bacon and cheese and fry them! Yes it's a heart attack (don't judge me), but a delicious one. I did however want more than 3 pieces, I guess for the $6 you pay and all the effort it's worth it, but I was hooked. As for the pizza I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and it was good as well, I personally just like bigger pieces of ham and pineapple versus the tiny little ones. Still very good taste, crust was not thick and great sauce flavor. I was also surprised that a large pie looked like a medium pie from some other places. Overall I am def a fan and have made them my go to pizza place now.
13374	68	1.0	1	2012-12-21	Never consistent ,except for the pigeon wings how cheap can u be go anywhere else
10909	68	4.0	1	2012-09-23	"My daughter just started a gymnastics class in Ewing so we decided to give Palermo's a try for some GF pizza. As we walked in we noticed at least 10 people picking up pizza. We managed to get the last available table (this was Friday night @ 6:30.) Our server was super friendly and it was obvious the owner must do a thorough food allergy training. She explained how there are separate areas for prep and everything is made on the premises. The GF menu incl. gnocchi, ravioli, pasta, two kinds of pizza (regular personal size & a thin crust which I would equate to a Schar brand crust) and sometimes dessert (they ran out the night we were there). We ordered gnocchi and both pizza's. The sauce and cheese on the pizza was delicious, so good but the crust on the ""thin"" crust pizza was more like a GF cracker - not so good. The personal size pizza crust was better. The gnocchi? Omg good and the marinara sauce was yummy too. Overall, we will defiantly be back and recommend to anyone on the area looking for a great GF option."
13375	68	1.0	1	2012-08-17	By far the worst pizzeria in Ewing. The first few times I ordered from them they burnt my pizza. After calling back to speak to the manager he said I should request the pizza be cooked lightly. Apparently they can't follow instructions. My pizza was again delivered burnt to a crisp in spite of my explicit instructions. I immediately called the restaurant to speak to the manager at which time he informed me that simply asking them not to burn my pizza was not enough.  I apparently needed to beg them not to burn it!  In addition they have a fryer that makes everything soggy with oil. Again I was told it was my fault! I shouldn't order fry items if I don't want them drenched in oil.
13376	68	4.0	1	2012-08-05	Good food.  The tomato pie was new to me,  but great.  Very light crust. I would avoid the wings (very small) and the Calmari (frozen).  The BYOB policy surprised me at first,  but I really like now. Plenty of seating,  but the parking is limited. The staff is friendly and fast.  I would go again for sure.
13377	68	4.0	1	2012-07-22	Very good tomato pie.  Friendly service.
8492	68	4.0	1	2012-07-02	They have the best tomato pie. So amazingly good. I would avoid the buffalo wings from here though. They are probably the smallest wings I have ever seen.
7363	68	2.0	1	2012-06-21	I would discourage you from ordering here! 3 co-workers and myself ordered delivery here at 11:40 am. We ordered a couple sandwiches/wraps and wings. Delivery took 1 hour an 15 mins! Rediculous. Meatball Parm had almost no sauce on it. Wings were the size of a small pinky finger. The other food was rated as mediocre. Doubt I would go back.
13378	68	5.0	1	2012-01-27	Its official: they employ the sweetest, nicest, quickest, most considerate drivers. I love this place! Try them for delivery; an impression has been made!
8494	68	4.0	1	2012-01-15	Great tomato pie, it's a must have!  Small parking lot, so sometimes you need to get creative parking on the side street.  It's a BYOB and the service has always been excellent.  Delivery is slow considering how close I live to this place.
13379	68	3.0	1	2011-10-11	"Eh. Their Paninis/Sandwiches are good. Pasta Isn't. Haven't tried tomato pies but that will get sampled and reviewed accordingly. Very hit and miss. Kind of pricey for the value. Service is spotty. I will give 3 stars instead of 2 because of this: They were very nice when they mixed up our orders. Well technically someone at the table gulfed down half of my food before I could wave someone over to point out that I didn't get what I ordered. It was actually hilarious how oblivious the person was that they were attacking MY meal...It was just a strange situation. I seriously can't think of one time other than this that I ""sent food back"" other than this even though I didn't even touch it...but they were very nice to bring me what I ordered anyway even though technically it was his fault for eating the wrong meal... (rolls eyes)...It was a teacher who was treating us and I was trying not to be rude and interrupt his convo. I was very mousy back in high school..."
13380	68	5.0	1	2011-09-08	Excellent food
13381	68	3.0	1	2011-07-19	I think this was a case of ordering the wrong thing because the place smelled incredible and other dishes looked much better than mine. I got chicken with mushrooms, ham and mozzarella. Sounds awesome, right? The sauce was ... I don't know what it was but it wasn't good. It had an odd taste, maybe an herb that I can't place? Either way, I didn't eat much of it. BUT the side of ziti with red sauce was delish. And the bread I used to sop up said red sauce was also really good. I think they make it with pizza crust and load it up with spices. I would certainly give this place another try. It's been open over a decade and you can't operate an Italian restaurant in Jerz for that long without being decent. Will have to try again ...
13382	68	3.0	1	2011-06-14	This is 4-5 star pizza with 1-2 star service. It's really a shame that each time we have ordered it has been over an hour for delivery(we live 10 min away), because I love their pizza. Room for improvement for sure.
13383	68	3.0	1	2011-01-21	The tomato pie was just ok..the crust was nice and crispy, but overall, it was nothing to write home about.
8500	68	2.0	1	2010-09-25	"Yeah after a few more orders from here, I'm getting the feeling that there is a big drop-off in excellence after the tomato pie. Other kinds of pizzas have been consistently underwhelming: light on toppings, which are always scattered around carelessly; bland crust (though crispy and chewy in parts); and poorly described (e.g., the ""Summer"" pizza, described on the menu as ""with fresh tomatoes, fresh basil, and olive oil"", was basically just a really thin regular cheese pizza with a few 1-inch chunks of beefsteak tomatoes and a few barely perceptible ribbons of basil (probably a total of one basil leaf on the entire pizza). Wheat crust is really odd, like they pre-make or pre-buy them and then freeeze them. Our house salad had many browned leaves, and tasted really weird, like a refrigerator. Palermo's is the best tomato pie I've ever had, but that's about all I'll order here now."
13384	68	4.0	1	2010-08-19	Great food.  Awesome service.  Responsive to food allergy requests - and they have gluten-free choices.  :)
13385	68	4.0	1	2010-07-05	The tomato pies here are pretty good! When it's made right, the crust is crispy and thin and the sauce is flavorful. I always get the sausage bec its my fav :) but its a hit or miss when it comes to getting a tomato pie here that isnt too greasy from the sausage fat that the crust is soggy at the bottom. This place is very convenient to get to, parking has never been an issue and theres never been a wait to be seated (Unlike delorenzos in robbinsville, our fav) sooo we continue to come here and hope for an ungreasy bottom :op
13386	68	5.0	1	2010-06-01	Tomato pie with peppers, garlic, and sausage. There is no substitute. The tomato pie here is absolute perfection. Not to be matched, I don't care where you're from. I've had pizza in Chicago, Brooklyn, you name it: this pie rocks. Outside of the tomato pie, the food is not extraordinary, but pretty good. You won't see a huge Sysco truck outside this place. They don't serve stuff out of 5-gallon buckets (you didn't know restaurants did that, did you?). They make fresh food. Probably my favorite dish that doesn't have a crust is the Vodka Rigatoni. Very good. I've also had the ziti, and the lasagna. Both good. I have eaten at this place *a lot*. The service is occasionally slow, but always friendly, and I don't believe I've *ever* had an order get messed up or forgotten, or whatever. It occasionally takes a few extra minutes, but when it comes out, all's well with the world.
8479	68	2.0	1	2010-03-02	Try the MILANO panini (Roast Pork & Broccoli Rabe), tasted below average and the bowtie pasta salad is too greasy. Two stars for the food. Just order takeout, cannot comment about the service.
13387	68	4.0	1	2009-08-27	Great neighborhood pizza place.  Saw the review here and picked up a pie.  It was good, straight-up pizza.  Much better than the chains and very friendly service.
13388	68	5.0	1	2009-01-14	Everything you could asak for in a neighborhood. Good variety, often quite creative and inspired while being consistantly good  with the standard Italian offerings. Portions are generous. Good service. BYOB a nice plus.
13389	68	5.0	1	2008-08-12	In a very secluded spot that's always packed with people in the know, Palermo's III is basically one of the hidden gems of Ewing, NJ. The dishes are all very authentic, delicious, and appropriately priced. BYOB if you wish. You may have heard: the real star of the show is indeed the tomato pie, and it is absolutely an exemplar of the style. Get there before 5 or you will be waiting to sit down. Service is always courteous if not quick. Quality is always great.
13390	69	3.0	-1	2014-10-26	Food was absolutely amazing but waiting on the waiters took for ever! Had my table waiting for about 30minutes until the waiter showed up with just drinks then another hour for the food. After that the waiter didnt show up until we were literally done with the food.
13391	69	4.0	-1	2014-11-07	Such a beautiful lil restaurant, amazing service and delicious food. Perfectly casual but special. Incredible vanilla pear jam, had to buy two jars for $10 each. We ordered the huge Jezebel wings, 3 to share between 2 was plenty. Prawns and grits and netty biscuit. Mini biscuit side was a great taster, had to finish off with the chocolate cake. Very memorable!
13392	69	4.0	-1	2014-07-23	After having eaten here several times and meeting the owners, I really want Beehive Oven to succeed.  The owners seem like good people .... BUT..... the restaurant has a few issues.  First of all the location s*cks.  It may not be there fault (do to budget etc.) but THAT corner, in THAT building...it has a really negative vibe.  Could go into more detail here but I'll refrain.  They are trying to spruce it up but ultimately the location has a lot to be desired.  As far as the food.  Its good.  Its decent.  But one cant help comparing it to Pie's & Thigh's 2 blocks over.  My take is that they (Beehive) shouldn't have to tried to do the fancy/southern food thing.  Williamsburg has tons (too many) nice, fine dining, fusion establishments already.  If people want that there are plenty of places to go.  But if they want good ole fashioned southern food, home cooking (however you categorize it) there are very few options.  So therefore they (Beehive) should STICK TO THAT!  Don't try to make if fancy, just DO IT RIGHT!  Keep it simple.  That's why Pie's & Thigh's is so successful because they serve up what its meant to be.  Not something that's obviously trying too hard to be a new and contemporary take on southern fare etc.  Btw, the biscuits are kinda small. And like I mentioned before, the entrees are trying way too hard to be something different.  Also they don't transfer well into a takeout meal.  Did that once and it was a cold mess.  As far as atmosphere, its a little bright (at night) for my taste.  And the hours are posted outside the door in front but they don't seem to be accurate...or at least not yet.  ANYWAY, I feel bad for writing a lot of this because I like them and I want them to succeed.  I just figured I should be honest and hope that it helps them in the long run.
13393	69	5.0	-1	2015-01-05	OMG ! Is all I have to say. My boyfriend and I came here on a date this past Saturday night. Firstly the service was outstanding, everyone was so kind and attentive. Secondly that buttermilk dressing with the dill is insanely delicious. We tried the Fried Green Tomatoes which I would highly recommend. I had the chicken pot pie, and it was probably the best pot pie I have ever had. The shrimp and grits were also amazing, and perfectly cooked. I would highly recommend trying the fried okra ! SO different and so flavorful. We are definitely coming here again, I have to say, this is probably one of the best restaurants I have eaten at in this area.
13394	69	5.0	-1	2014-12-31	Found this based on the reviews and must say I am glad I did.  Read the good reviews and just go!
13395	69	5.0	-1	2014-11-17	We found this place thanks to YELP. It had 40+ reviews and a score of 5. That was attention enough to give it a try. The place is small, but you won't feel yourself in a box, you have your room to eat. We arrived one saturday at 15pm and it was complete so we waited a few minutes and had a seat on the bar. The owner was very kind and gentle and explained to us the menus (we're from Spain and we were a bit lost about what to eat). My GF and I had an excellent service and food. The owner took care of us perfectly. Sadly there was no cake avaiable at that moment but that makes a good excuse to come back again! 10/10 will repeat and taste the chicken wings!
13396	69	5.0	-1	2014-11-13	What a terrific experience! Originally planning to drop by for a beer to check out Beehive Oven, our party of 3 stayed a couple of hours enjoying the great food, drink and company! Delicious food with a Southern flair and cold, cold brewskis were enhanced by the warm atmosphere, original artwork and friendly and attentive owners and staff. No pretension - just fun!
13397	69	5.0	-1	2014-09-24	"I had to create a YELP account (after living and eating Williamsburg for 5 years) just to love on Beehive Oven in the public sphere.  My boyfriend and I had the most wonderful meal here at Happy Hour today (a Wednesday). We ordered: A. Jezebel Wings with Buttermilk Dressing appetizer They are three very big (jumbo) wings that are fried to perfection and covered with the yummiest sweet and hot Jezebel sauce (almost like a chutney)...unbelievably tasty! B. Fried Green Tomatoes with Remoulade appetizer: I wanted to have these and watermelon lemonade on a porch every afternoon for the rest of my life while watching a little bird come down the walk and writing songs on a banjo. C. 2 Deviled Eggs (appetizer) We said cheers, bumped them together and were off!  Like eating nice chocolates from a box, each a mini celebration. Rich and decadent! We had to ignore the fact that we did little to earn them that morning.. D. An Abita Pecan beer and a Capt. Kolsch beer (they're a Texan run establishment, and they gotchu covered on that Shiner Bock!) E. The Nettie Biscuit for me (Named after the owner's true-Texan grandmother.  She smiles from a farm somewhere in TX surrounded by chickens in black and white photo posted near the kitchen) and the motto is-- ""Nettie would be proud"".  The fried chicken and the biscuit are both heavenly. F. Shrimp and Grits with Fried Okra for him (a generous portion of shrimp and an almost gumbo-like sauce on top of the grits (bell pepper, onion) that was so flavorful and delish. I managed to take a bite before it vanished.. G. YOU MUST ORDER One Slice of Hummingbird Cake (homemade, total food science as far as being perfectly moist/balanced/creamy etc. and such a treat.) H. 2 Coffees :) 1. This cost us 45 dollars. In Williamsburg! 2. We obviously had a trigger-happy moment and ordered everything on the menu, but we ate every single bite of it all, except for a few okra which we took home with us.  It was just so good. The best thing about Beehive Oven though is not the food. It's the owners..if you have a chance to talk to the owners John and Trevva..they are so hospitable and warm you feel like you're in someone's country home.  If at this point you're thinking that I am not accustomed to thinking critically, you read my review correctly.  There was nothing to break down about the experience.  Just a great one! If they ever open up a bed and breakfast I am so there! That said, I promise not to Yelp so basically again unless it's really dire. Best, Noni"
13398	69	5.0	-1	2014-08-25	The BeeHive Oven Café is one of those rarities in New York, but particularly in a self-important Williamsburg, that feels genuinely like home. I and my boyfriend were greeted by John, the friendliest man that you may ever meet in New York, and he showed us to our table in the cozy space. Say hello to John, ask him questions, he's an absolute stand up gentleman. Adorable pasta strainers for shades, a humble staff, a drool-worthy menu, inventive riffs on classics drinks (try the Prickly Pear Lemonade. Just... just do it) and the wine and beer selection of a veteran Brooklyn spot, this place surprised and delighted me in the best way. We shared the jezebel wings (delicious, chutney like, the perfect balance of sweet and spicy), downed our Prickly Pear lemonade (seriously, get it) while munching on the welcome plate that each table receives (veggies and a delicious buttermilk dressing). I then had the Moselle while my boyfriend created his own biscuit sandwich (re-read that sentence: you can create YOUR OWN BISCUIT SANDWICH). The Moselle came with fried chicken a fried egg, collard greens and hot sauce which I opted out of and am happy I did so because I was really able to experience the delicious taste of the Beehive Oven's fried chicken. We're talking on par with Sweet Chick a few blocks away and the Redhead in the East Village. Treat yourself to it. I can't let you know how my boyfriend's dish was mostly due to it being gone by the time I was halfway through with my own food. He sighed a hearty appreciation though, which is a great sign given how particular he is. Not wanting to miss out, I ordered the Prickly Pear Mimosa (are you seeing a theme here?) and ordered a slice of the Red Velvet Cake with the boyfriend opting for the Banana Bread Pudding. The mimosa was delicious but the cake took the ... well, the cake. Soft, buttery, delicious and MASSIVE. I almost couldn't finish it and then found the will and courage to devour it entirely. The atmosphere at the Beehive Oven is comfortable and inviting, the prices cannot be beat, the food is delicious, the staff is friendly, and I'm writing this mostly because I want this place to be massively successful. That said, it's a hard to think that it might get too popular, because I don't want to have to wait for the phenomenal biscuits. Or the Prickly Pear lemonade. Which you should get.

13400	69	5.0	-1	2014-07-27	My absolute favorite brunch in all of New York City!  I grew up in the south and the biscuits are fantastic here.  Try the Sandra and the Nette, but to be honest, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  On top of great food, the owners and staff are all really fantastic.  Small town feel in the middle of the big city, couldn't ask for more!
13401	69	5.0	-1	2014-06-18	The food is amazing, the folks are super friendly, and the place is adorable. I went with a group of friends and ate off all their plates. Everything was delicious. The biscuits with honey and jam were  superb, and I could have eaten my weight in Jezebel wings. We had a sampler plate that included pickles, tiny biscuits, and ham. I had no idea ham could be that tasty.
13402	69	5.0	1	2015-01-06	Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Had the shrimp and grits for breakfast/lunch and stayed warm all day despite the freak Brooklyn snowstorm outside. I'll be coming in for brunch this weekend for sure, cheese grits with shrimp covered w warm yumm it was life transforming I felt like 22 again in a different gender..... Don't ask.   Over all it's an awesome place in a cool neighborhood and you should check it out.
13403	69	2.0	1	2015-01-04	Came here today with super high expectations for two reasons- 1. Five stars on Yelp 2. The claim to have the best biscuits in NYC.  Well, I left underwhelmed and disappointed.  The biscuits are terrible. Dry, hard, tasteless  and butter-less. I'm not sure how or why these biscuits are considered delicious. I also left hungry. The chicken biscuit sandwich was way too small. There's nothing worse than leaving a restaurant still hungry after you finished your meal.  My date shared the same sentiments. He ordered a chicken biscuit and the open faced turkey sandwich. On the upside, I did enjoy the fried okra and the chicken on my biscuit was well seasoned and juicy. Also, our waiter and the young lady at the front of the house were welcoming and attentive. Unfortunately, I don't have any plans to return and most definitely not for the biscuits.
13404	69	5.0	1	2015-01-04	I'm a fan! The chicken steak brunch was perfection. Will definitely come back for more!
13405	69	4.0	1	2015-01-03	food was awesome. People were awesome. A little bit of a wait to just get us menus was kind of annoying and some pretty cramped quarters for sitting but you forget about all of that once you start eating that awesome food
13406	69	5.0	1	2015-01-02	Delicious biscuits with solid veggie options. We had mushroom gravy, collared greens, fried green tomatoes and grits - all of which were fantastic. Also dig the spicy jelly. And John and co. are super sweet and personable.
13407	69	2.0	1	2015-01-02	"I was really looking forward to coming and enjoying this new hot spot in South Williamsburg not only because of all the great reviews, but I used to live in the South and love love LOVE great biscuits. Unfortunately, my experience was sub-par. I came on NYE in the afternoon with a long time industry friend. We wanted to catch up and have some great food ( I had previously looked at the menu prior to coming.) When we got to the table, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come to the table. I was getting hungry, but was okay because the ambiance seemed nice and my friend was catching up with me. The waitress came to the table and brought a water bottle, but did not bring glasses. WE asked for coffee and ordered some appetizers immediately. She seemed perplexed and not happy to be in the cafe. The place was about half-full at this time, and the owner seemed to be there, but was only mildly helping. We had some veggies brought to the table as a welcome which was nice, but the veggies were all wilted and looked like they were rotting. We thought the color meant that they were pickled, but they definitely were not. The dip was very nice though. We had to ask for water glasses. The deviled eggs were awesome and different- which was nice. The fried green tomatoes were just blah, and the waitress gave us a suggestion to get a couple biscuits to share. I would not recommend sharing because when they came to the table the biscuits are really made for individuals and hard to cut. I ate the biscuits quickly because I was hungry, but they were not very good. I couldn't taste the ingredients in the biscuits. They also put like a grocery store mesculin mix on the biscuit which made it wilt and soggy. I hate when chefs put that on warm sandwiches- who thinks that tastes good?! Also, the food is prefaced that it is made by Texans, which is very different from Georgia, where I lived. The flavors are more savory and less sweet, salty, and spicy. I even did not like the honey mustard, and I love ALL mustard. The coleslaw that accompanied the meal was truly gross and tasteless. Very disappointing. When we were eating, the waitress had a couple come in, and she seemed mildly busy, but she was very intense with them saying something like, ""I'm busy right now. I'll be there in a second, okay?!"" She even made a party of three create their own table because the owner and waitress lacked communication to help set a table up for them. I'm not trying to get on the waitress, but it made the experience uncomfortable. Also, I despise having to pay with an iPad at the table. I have to give my tip there, and hand it right back to the waitress, and although I never give under 20% for service, I couldn't justify giving more than 17% today. Why do people in this industry think this is a good thing? The cafe is slow and comfortable. no need to rush paying at the table because it appears convenient to the guest. I'm willing to give this place another chance, but I'm completely baffled as to why people feel this place is amazing."
13408	69	5.0	1	2015-01-01	Cute and cozy. All the goodness of Southern cooking with emphasis on biscuits. The shrimps and grits is outstanding but everything is pretty darn good all around. I was there for dinner but it seems to be a good brunch place too. Another great spot by the bridge!
13409	69	5.0	1	2014-12-30	Worth every star! We came into Williamsburg on our last day in the city before headed back to California. As a born and bred Alabamian, I can tell you they nailed the Southern flavors! We tried the chicken biscuit, honey biscuit and the sausage gravy- all three were AWESOME! And the buttermilk ranch with the crudités was also a great touch. Highly recommend and a great find!
13410	69	5.0	1	2014-12-29	Great choice! you wont regret if you're into traditional food just be aware that you will also be surprised with a little twist of new flavors you wouldn't imagine they could be together so delicious. Jalapeño jello? yes it was delicious!
13411	69	5.0	1	2014-12-29	the food here is fantastic! everything is homemade and delicious time after time. the fried chicken and biscuits are always perfect and i love trying all of their offerings. their desserts are awesome too, especially the texas sheet cake. super friendly and homey feel that really makes you want to return.
13412	69	5.0	1	2014-12-28	Get ready because this will be long! Wow! I had high expectations for this place because of all the good reviews before me but wow!! Just wow! For a little backstory, I got engaged on Christmas day and my fiance and I wanted to do a quick celebration with close friends. As usual, I took to Yelp to find a new brunch spot that could accommodate a group of 12-15. I found BeeHive and immediately made a reservation for the next day (a Saturday). Well, it ended up that I had to change the reservation to Sunday because of some schedule changes, so Saturday morning I called BeeHive and explained my situation and was told I would get a call back in a few hours. I received a call within the hour from John. Let me just tell you, from that moment on, my fiance and I and our group were well taken care of! John made it known that they actually did not take reservations for brunch but was happy that I called because now he had a heads up that a large group would be coming. He even suggested a time for my group and I to gather and that he would do what he could to make us comfortable. Well, he did that and so much more! The moment I arrived, he came out to greet me and ensured that we would be seated soon. My group of about 15 was seated within about 15 min!! And that's mostly because we were waiting for a few more of my group to arrive. Now the food... well let's just say no one left hungry nor with a crumb on their plate! And these were some picky people!! The biscuits are amazing (I bought a bag to take home!), the pepper jam is to die for and the sausage gravy hits your savory spot HARD! A few in my group had the jezebel wings which were apparently delicious because I didn't even have time to ask for a bite! The deviled eggs were super tasty and the fried chicken was the perfect amount of salty and so perfectly juicy! Oh and the fried green tomatoes, the fried okra, and the prickly pear mimosa!!! Yumm! I can't wait to go back! Good thing I'm not too far! Ok I don't want to keep rambling on but just go here and give John a big hug because he is the sweetest man! The whole BeeHive crew was so warm and welcoming to us and for that I am super grateful! By the way, John co-owns BeeHive with his wife who is the chef (and who also came out to greet us!) and their daughter, Emily, is one of the servers! What a beautiful family they are! So many restaurants in Brooklyn, especially in Williamsburg but it's not often that you come across a more accommodating and friendly group of people! Just go!
13413	69	5.0	1	2014-12-28	Been here twice and both times have been great. John and his family are kind and attentive, the atmosphere is wonderful and the food is fantasic. Dined on my egg, bacon, pickled squash and honey biscuit to Frank Sinatra this morning and it was lovely.
13414	69	5.0	1	2014-12-27	Everything about this place is so special.  I like that it is intimate and cozy.  The staff, as others have mentioned is so kind and friendly, and not just the owners.  Though, they are too!   In particular, though, the food is amazing: every bite delicious- fried green tomatoes, deviled eggs, chicken fried steaks, grits  & shrimp... Yum, yum, yum, yum.  And don't get me started on the biscuits.... One other note- they were extremely kind and easy-going about kids.  Our 5- yr old twins are restaurant pros, but it still nice when restaurants go out of their way to talk to them.  In this case, let them look in the kitchen and told them about bees, gave them temporary tattoos, and generally made them feel welcome.   We will def plan another visit soon!
13415	69	3.0	1	2014-12-27	Really cute place with good service. Really delicious free vegetable platter with their ranch sauce. Ordered fried green tomatoes, as good as tomatoes can be. Got their jezebel wings which were really bad. The sauce tasted good, but the wings were really rubbery which means that its not as crispy as it can be and it was a bit undercooked as well. It was really hard to pull the wings apart and the meat was pink in certain areas. I fried over 10000 wings in my life being that my parents had a restaurant that specialized in wings so I think I have some credentials with wings. The waitress told me that they check the temperature which I believe but with wings the joint area always take longer and if the skin is rubbery, you must fry it for longer. A good wing is good enough to bite on the bones and suck the marrow out which would have been raw with these wings. Really great biscuits. Shrimp and grits were okay, basic tomato sauce and really small shrimps so its not worth the $15. These are frozen small shrimps that doesnt come with the tail so it's probably been pre peeled which are not good quality. At least they took the vein out, but as far as getting your moneys worth, it is not a dish you want to order. Besides the undercooked/under cripsy wings, and the poor shrimp quality, this is a good place.
13416	69	5.0	1	2014-12-27	I've been to this place many times. John and his wife are fantastic. Everything is made in house from scratch - the biscuits, jellies, fried chicken. Everything here is excellent and reasonably priced. Must try this place.
13417	69	5.0	1	2014-12-24	Took a friend from Florida to Williamsburg to show her around. Not many places were open since it is Christmas Eve. Fairly priced, this place got amazing mini-biscuits and really delicious and rich chicken potpie. The fried chicken steak has very special breadijg that adds a nice crunch. The vanilla pear marmalade is very impressive. Service was great - no complaints. Will come back here with others for sure.
13418	69	5.0	1	2014-12-20	Delicious food and some of the best service I've experienced in New York. Haven't met a group of staff that is nicer or more inviting in the city. The owner is as warm as he can be. You will leave feeling filled with comfort food and like you have found a new neighborhood spot.
13419	69	5.0	1	2014-12-20	My husband and I were looking to have breakfast and decided to drive to Brooklyn. On the way I found this place on yelp and after awesome ratings and comments we decided to check it out. After being a few minutes away we noticed they didn't open until 10a so we parked in front and waited 30 minutes for them to open. It was well worth the wait. The decor inside is beautiful, clean very much feels like Texas. The waitress was welcoming and very friendly. One of the owners Jon also greeted us at the end of meal and was very friendly. We started with their complimentary buttermilk ranch dressing and veggies and added deviled eggs. I ordered an egg & grits breakfast and my husband ordered a special eggs Benedict style breakfast with their home-made queso hollandaise sauce. To top it off we added their pumpkin biscuit with maple butter. A must try while it's still available! The food was delicious, decor beautiful & clean, service friendly & attentive.  We can't wait to return with our kids!
13420	69	5.0	1	2014-12-17	Very good biscuits! I loved the mushroom gravy. Nice little place, somewhat out of the way. Great atmosphere, great service.
13421	69	5.0	1	2014-12-17	Amazing fried chicken biscuits and really good chicken fried steak biscuit sandwiches! I suggest the lemonade apple cider heated
13422	69	5.0	1	2014-12-17	My wife and I spent a weekend in NYC and had brunch in Williamsburg twice. BeeHive Oven was one of the highlights of our trip. We arrived around noon last Sunday before heading to a Broadway show and then to the airport, so we had our bags with us. There was a slight wait, less than 30 minutes. One of the owners, John, offered us coffee and cider lemonade while we were waiting for a table, which was very much appreciated. He took the time to chat with me for a bit, and also pointed out a spot by the door where we could put our bags during our meal. We both love deviled eggs, so those were a must-have appetizer. I had the Tex Eggs Benedict, and Rose had the Build Your Own Biscuit Sandwich option. Everything was phenomenal! We had enough room to split a dessert, so we went with the fruit biscuit pudding, and it was a great way to finish the meal. We felt welcomed from the second we stepped in the door. Take the time to stop in here for a great Southern meal. You won't regret it!
13423	69	2.0	1	2014-12-13	This was OK. Service was pleasant but not friendly and the server forgot to enter one of our items. Price is not cheap for what you get. Brunch plates were not the size that is shown in the pictures on here. I arrived very hungry and left hungry, $12 for an appetizer portion. It also did not come with fresh orange like other reviews stated. The sausage gravy was very nice, but the biscuit was dry. If you are looking for an excellent biscuit I would go to Pies and thighs or Brooklyn Star, but in all honesty most places in the area are better than this.
13424	69	5.0	1	2014-12-13	An adorable little cafe run by two Texans, this is THE place to go for a biscuit.
13425	69	5.0	1	2014-12-11	This place has over 60 reviews and it's still 5 stars, and I know why! I went with a girlfriend  for brunch.  We both did the make-your-own buscuits option, had coffee, and shared a side of grits.  Holy hell.  Everything was ON POINT.  I was loving every bite and sip, and the sausage gravy was especially delicious.  We debated ordering dessert but were too stuffed - next time for sure.  My friend is from South Carolina and the owner talked to us for a bit - really nice guy.  I couldn't connect to their wifi from the posted sign, but I also didn't ask for help.  Will definitely be going back.
13426	69	5.0	1	2014-12-09	This restaurant was amazing. I had the nettie and the fried chicken/bacon/buttermilk combo was incredible. Service was great and so was the pear lemonade.
13427	69	5.0	1	2014-12-09	Simply put, this place is so good! The buttermilk biscuit is the best I've ever had. My favorite meal is the salad with homemade dill & buttermilk dressing and fried chicken on top with a biscuit on the side. Perfect lunch!
13428	69	5.0	1	2014-12-07	Recently stopped in to the BeeHive Oven and had an awesome meal (dinner) from start to finish: Veggie Plate w/ Homemade Buttermilk Dressing Deviled Eggs Fried Green Tomatoes Jezebel Wings The Nettie Shrimp & Grits Fruit Biscuit Pudding (order even if you're full) Staff was super attentive, friendly, and made you feel like you were at home. Plus, they had a nice little beer selection to pair with your biscuit sandwich and southern hospitality.
13429	69	5.0	1	2014-12-07	What a delightful place for brunch! The staff here is extremely friendly and welcoming. This small spot serves up Texas style food with special emphasis on biscuits. The host/greeter John mentioned the chef previously worked for the food network. I had the chicken biscuit and the cinnabun with caramel icing. Both were drop dead delicious. If you are looking for a cozy spot for brunch, this is the best place in town.
13430	69	5.0	1	2014-12-06	Oh My...... What a find. While searching for good eats with my family in Williamsburg, New York, we stumbled upon one of the Best restaurants we've ever encountered... And we eat out at a lot if places, all around the world! From amazing pear lemonade mimosas to homemade biscuits..... Homemade jams to chicken pot pie, every dish (and drink) was better than the last..... and the service by everyone including the owners was absolutely wonderful...... Welcoming, warm and helpful.  Great atmosphere, great company, great service, great food, great drinks.... We'll be back!!!  Thank you everyone for making this such an exciting adventure!!
13431	69	5.0	1	2014-11-30	What a great first experience at the Biscuit Cafe! Charles was our server and even while waiting on 3 other tables, he was still super attentive and friendly during our meal. We ordered the chicken wings to start and they were HUGE. Very juicy and the buttermilk sauce it came with was so delicious. Then built my own biscuit sandwich with fried chicken, fried green tomato, and honey. It was just the right serving size and I left feeling perfectly full. The highlight of our meal definitely had to be talking to the owner John. We ended up staying an extra hour sharing stories with him. John, thanks for the great meal and talk!!
13432	69	5.0	1	2014-11-25	A sweet Southern beauty with so much taste and class. The biscuits are divine. The style is so reminiscent of the South. It's quaint and charming. Go. You'll love it and chime to your friends about how cute it is.
13433	69	5.0	1	2014-11-25	Living in Williamsburg for over 6yrs, it's hard to keep up with the restaurant boom and all the new places popping up. I'm glad we ventured out to this place because what a gem! It was a quaint and lovely restaurant. As someone who loves fried chicken, I decided to try new foods that I've never had before and I was glad that I did! Fried green tomato with remoulade sauce (which was unreal) was a great starter! My meal consisted of chicken fried steak with grits, 2 sunny side up eggs, biscuit, and strawberry jam. The problem with this meal is that it has now set the bar extremely high if I decide to have chicken fried steak somewhere else! Everything was so flavorful that we can't wait to go back and try everything else. Usually when you land on a dish you love, you end up getting it over and over, but with Beehive, it seems like every table ordered something different because it's the kind of place where you really can't go wrong. The owner was friendly and involved. I'm sure beehive will prosper because of such great cooking and customer service. We look forward to coming back many times and eventually making it to their delicious lookin desserts.
13434	69	5.0	1	2014-11-25	YUMMMMMMMM! Their chicken biscuits are to die for. So crispy and delicious. I ordered the chicken biscuit with pimento! again, YUM! Def. recommend! I also ordered dessert. I had the chocolate cake. Not my fav, but it was still tasty and I didn't leave any bites, so that says something right?! The owner, John, is so nice too. He told me all about his and his family's story. As I can tell by the other reviews too, the owners really do make this restaurant a 5-star location. Wish I lived in the area so I could return. I wish I had more as I'm writing this review. YUM YUM :)
13435	69	5.0	1	2014-11-23	I have been here half a dozen times or so and I plan on going back many, many more times.  The first time I went, I ended up hanging out for about 3 and a half hours.  John and Treva are so nice and work very hard to remember faces and names.  They also will chat with you as long as they aren't busy which I love (Southern hospitality, ya'll).  Being from the south, I'm always getting a hankering for biscuits and gravy and fried okra... two things that can be tricky to find in the city.  Thankfully, Beehive has both!  Even though I love those two things, I always try to eat something different every time I go and haven't been let down yet.  The biscuit pudding is a meal in and of itself (I've had the plum, peach, and apple - all uh.maze.ing!) and is a must even if you have to pack it up and take it home.   It's started to get popular and busy and sometimes the service isn't always top notch but I've never had it be terrible.  Occasionally I've had to remind them about my fried okra order which I always get as a side.  I'm personally glad to see them doing so well and I hope their good fortune continues. I also love that they rotate their beers on tap.  Between that and the food, they get a 5-star rating from me.  The decor is pretty great too (the bathroom decor is hands down the best though.  It's my favorite bathroom in the city and you should definitely go wash your hands or something).  They are also starting to expand their menu and I'm excited to see what the future holds.  Definitely give them your business and meet John and Treva if they are around.   Good people, good food, good times.  A++.
13436	69	5.0	1	2014-11-23	This place is so great! Went for brunch, had the chicken fried steak and eggs. So delicious. The biscuits are really good too. Can't wait to go back for the chicken fried steak dinner :) The best thing about all of it is there was no obnoxious two hour wait to sit down. We walked right in. The staff was very friendly. Go to this place!!! You will be so happy.
13437	69	5.0	1	2014-11-22	Amazing. Stopped by tonight and John the owner took care of my group of 7. He was so helpful and welcoming. The atmosphere was great and the food was amazing. The entire group had different biscuit sandwiches, which we all loved, and couldn't stop talking about. I got the Nettie, the buttermilk dressing with the fried chicken was perfection. And for dessert everyone who comes here needs to have the hummingbird cake. You won't regret it.
13438	69	5.0	1	2014-11-19	"So glad this Smorgasburg hit opened its first brick and mortar biz right across the street from my house. You can often smell the fresh baked goodness right from the street. I came here with my guy, who ordered the shrimp and grits with a fruit salad on the side. Was his pick as tasty as it was colorful? Indeed. As for me, I had to order a biscuit from a place that bills itself as a ""biscuit cafe"" (really, it's on a handpainted sign outside). The Moselle biscuit is all your soul food faves served on a buttery gold biscuit: fried chicken, collard greens, fried egg, and hot sauce. The crisp apple raisin slaw is a notch above your standard cole slaw. If you're thirsty, try the prickly pear lemonade, which is just the right amount of sweet, despite its name. I will be returning to sample each menu item, even if I have to come alone. With its shabby rustica decor and cozy ambiance, Bee Hive Oven is the kind of eatery that invites you to linger awhile, especially now that the weather's getting chilly out!"
13439	69	5.0	1	2014-11-16	Went there today for brunch and it was amazing! The couple that own it are also super sweet and really engaged in the customer service. As far as the food, I've been searching for a tasty biscuits and gravy and this place delivers. Oh! The red velvet cake was awesome too. Support this new little restaurant.
13440	69	5.0	1	2014-11-15	Warm, low-key atmosphere. Best southern food in the neighborhood. Came here with a group of 7 girls on a busy Friday night and the service was still top notch.
13441	69	4.0	1	2014-11-14	"Update on 11/15 (Original review on 11/14) After my original yelp review the owner reached out to me directly.  He was committed to understanding what happened and to finding a resolution to my concerns.  You can't ask for more from an owner or manager.  He cares about his customers!   After looking at reviews on yelp and seeing the five star rating, I decided to venture out to check out Bee Hive for dinner.   What did I order: 1.  Deviled Eggs - 2 2.  The Sandra 3.  Red Velvet Cake Verdict 1.  Deviled Eggs - Very good!  Perfect balance of ingredients. Recommend ordering these. 2.  The Sandra - Also very good.  Great flavor.  The biscuit was wonderful and I am speaking from growing up in the South.  The combination of the biscuit, gravy, and egg made for a delicious and comforting meal. 3.   Red Velvet Cake - When I ordered I asked how fresh the cake was and was told they are made at the restaurant. Not quite an answer to my question but I felt it would be worth the risk so I ordered a slice to go.  HUGE mistake - The cake was so dry.    I called the restaurant and mentioned the cake was very dry and the lady who answered the phone said ""I don't think we have a return policy on cake"".  That was it.  No offer to refund.  No offer to provide a new slice.  Nada. All in all the food was great!.  If you are in the mood for a biscuit or biscuit sandwich I would go to Bee Hive!  The service left a lot to be desired, but I am positive the owner will work with his staff on how to handle issues when they are brought up by customers."
13442	69	4.0	1	2014-11-11	Nice addition to the hood. The biscuits sandwiches are delicious and reasonably priced. I also love that it comes with a complimentary starter plate of veggies. The owner John was lovely as well. There is nothing better than spending money at an establishment whose management really makes an effort to take time to talk to his customers.
13443	69	4.0	1	2014-11-08	A near perfect experience. As a Southern expat, there's a lot of foods I miss living in NYC. (This city does NOT have queso - how is that?) Biscuits are hard to come by in the city, so when we saw this place was nearby a show we were going to later, we decided to check it out. I was impressed right away with the quirky Southern decor. It was charming without seeming cheesy - lots of colanders and wood. Our waiter was AWESOME. I think his name was Charlie? He was very attentive and friendly. The boy and I each got custom biscuit sandwiches with a side of mashed potatoes. He got fried chicken and honey, while I got bacon and pimento cheese. The biscuit was $7 and the mashed potatoes were $4. We split a piece of Chocolate Birthcake for about $6. Everything was really yummy. The pimento cheese was slathered on the way I like it, and the biscuit was the just the right amount of crumbly. The cake is rich, so definitely split it with someone else. My biggest complaint - and what keeps his place from getting 5 stars - is how teeny the biscuit sandwich was. Where I'm from (NC), our biscuit sandwiches are monstrous things that will fill you. This was smaller than the palm of my hand and could probably be eaten in two big bites. I felt a little cheated for $7. On the other hand, you get a nice portion of mashed potatoes for $4, so that helps. I'll definitely be back to the Beehive Biscuit Cafe, but not as much as if the biscuits were a few dollars cheaper or a little bit bigger.
13444	69	5.0	1	2014-11-08	The owner (John) was wonderful to our party. We called ahead and they were able to accommodate a large group in a matter of minutes! The food was DELICIOUS and the service was fantastic. We will be back!
13445	69	5.0	1	2014-11-08	I came here at 10:30 on a Saturday--no wait right off of the bat, which was awesome, although the place quickly filled up as I was eating.  I was instantly greeted & sat at a cute little spot by the window.   My service overall was amazing--my server was super attentive and helpful; she clearly enjoyed working there.  The owner, John, also introduced himself-- this is a man who takes pride in what he does and knows his breakfasts!! I was torn between several menu items but decided in the end to build my own biscuit.  The fried chicken was crispy & delicious, the gravy was light & flavorful, and the biscuit was buttery heaven.  The portion was perfectly sized and a great value for the price. I also recommend the prickly pear mimosa.  It was tart & the most beautiful shade of pale pink. My only regret about my experience here is that I didn't take a bag of pumpkin biscuits to go!
13446	69	5.0	1	2014-11-07	It's been weeks and I'm still thinking about the warm biscuits with pear jam. This place is where I want to be every Sunday with a hot coffee eating a great breakfast. A truly delicious and unique addition to Williamsburg and NYC as a whole.
13447	69	5.0	1	2014-11-03	I'm always hesitant to dole out great recos to local gems, but this place deserves an inflow of business. The food is so authentic, delicious, well-priced and homey. The service is down-to-earth.  They take the extra mile from the owner down. The atmosphere is everything you'd want. Really happy to have them in the 'hood.
13448	69	5.0	1	2014-11-02	The owners are always there and treat every customer like family. The food is very fresh, the store actually closes twice a week so the staff can work on making fresh jams and biscuit mix from scratch. It would be tough to order something you didnt enjoy here, and the food options are simple enough to not bother recommending something specific. As far as the drinks, im a fan of the mint infused lemonade, but if that sounds too sugary, the mint tea is pretty great as well.
13449	69	5.0	1	2014-10-31	The service and the friendliness of the owner and staff is impeccable. You can't find this kind of Southern charm anywhere but the South, so this is a GEM! The food is wonderful and they cater to vegetarians as well. I love their fried green tomatoes, mushroom gravy biscuits, homemade sweet tea, house made buttermilk ranch dressing, and the care they really take in the quality of their food. I've been here several times with my roommate and the owner always comes up to chat with us and makes us feel super welcome. They deserve five stars all the way! Keep being awesome guys!
13450	69	5.0	1	2014-10-29	Had the 'Nettie' chicken and biscuit sandwich. The fried chicken was the best I've had in recent memory, and the creamy sauce and bacon were delicious. Looking forward to trying more.
11064	69	3.0	1	2014-10-26	5 stars for their amazing service- incredible waitstaff!!!! 1 star for their food. This was such a disappointment. When you walk in and get your seat, you look up above you and you see that ole' lone star flag hanging. Your hopes are high, you salivate thinking of the delicious biscuits ahead........ Sadly, expectations are simply not met here at BeeHive. My wife ordered a biscuit with collards and an egg. I ordered a biscuit with fried chicken, bacon, and cheddar. Both sound delicious right? They really weren't. The biscuits are so small. I've probably baked 2,000-3,000 biscuits in my life (Native Arkansan, half Texan) I've never baked such dried out discs that Beehive calls biscuits. Both of our biscuits were bone dry, almost dissolving in our hands when we picked up our biscuits, such a let down. The fried chicken was fine, not bad, but not great either. Both of us were hungry after our biscuits. We opted for a dessert, hoping it might salvage our experience. No bones there either. We ordered a chocolate layer cake. The problem- in between the chocolate cake were layers of cream cheese. Very weird, very weird. Their service is amazing, amongst the best I've had in Brooklyn. But, their food is an utter letdown, don't let any flags, catchy names, or anything else fool you. We won't be back, because I can bake better biscuits any day in my own oven.
13451	69	5.0	1	2014-10-25	This place is great!  Amazing food, pleasant and attentive service! Waiter was courteous, always making sure we were comfortable.  He made some recommendations that were spot on. Really liked the decor.  It has a Southern feel (they're from Texas), but it's not gimmicky.  Just feels homey.  Not intimidating, low key but not low maintenance. Food: Chicken wings - tangy, sweet, and a tinge of spice.  It melted in our mouths.  Only regret is we got the small (3) instead of the large (6).  Would definitely get again. Moselle chicken sandwich - its a chicken sandwich with egg.  Loved it.  Prob my favorite dish.  Chicken was really tender, possibly the most tender chicken I've had in the city (and we've tried many a places).  The egg yolk made for a perfect complement. Nettie chicken sandwhich - wifey liked this one more. Not as juicy but really crispy, which I also like.  Only downside is the biscuit was a bit hard, but it didn't detract from the taste. Biscuit bread pudding - they mix day old biscuit with seasonal fruit pudding (we had apple since its in season).  Man this was awesome...never had anything like it before.  Perfect combination of crispy soft biscuit with sweet syrupy fruit pudding.  Only suggestion would be to add some ice cream.  We mentioned this to the owner who we conversed with throughout the night; he said to stay tune because once he gets an ice cream license, he'll be adding store made ice cream to this and other dishes (but it'd be in his secret menu!). The owner John talked to us intermittently throughout our whole dinner, really friendly guy.  Also made us feel at home and always asked if we needed anything.  The service was top notch.  He also told us his story of how he moved here from Texas, fell in love with the city, wife taking culinary classes, and them opening up the restaurant when he got tired of working for Apple.  Living the dream! Overall, awesome food in a low key, friendly environment.  Will definitely be coming back and recommending to others!
13452	69	2.0	1	2014-10-19	Let me start by saying that the food is amazing and if I were judging solely on the food, I'd give it five stars. The service, however, is another story. I've been here three times, and each time (with different servers), the wait has been excruciatingly long and my order was delivered wrong. Most recently, I ordered a pumpkin biscuit (the pumpkin biscuits are mindblowing btw), but was disappointed to be delivered a regular biscuit. Our server was nice, kind, and accommodating but ultimately incompetent. This may be a reflection of the fact that beehive oven is less than six months old and is still finding its sweet spot. I feel bad giving it two stars but I feel like the terrible service really needs to be acknowledged.
13453	69	5.0	1	2014-10-18	You must go here. It's delicious. You won't regret it. Decent prices, usually good service. Never a wait. A million times better than pies and thighs.
13454	69	5.0	1	2014-10-02	As a New Yorker from Texas, I can honestly say this food is real and good! Evidence the chicken fried steak.  The owners are genuinely nice, the place is clean, design is pleasing and the food is worth a trip from Manhattan.  I'll be back to try the red velvet cake and the chilequiles for brunch ASAP!
13455	69	5.0	1	2014-09-28	As a southern girl, I'm always in the hunt for good southern-style restaurants in the city. This place hit the spot! I went for bunch and was greeted by John and his wife. They are both lovely and make you feel really welcome. Their food is incredible- I ordered biscuits and gravy, grits, bacon, and eggs and they were all delicious. I'll definitely be coming back!
13456	69	5.0	1	2014-09-25	Beehive Oven is AMAZING. Went in for dinner last night and to schedule catering for breakfast for the morning after my wedding. Treva and everyone were so incredibly helpful in letting me taste different things to figure out what I wanted, quantity etc. Everyone was just so warm and extremely helpful! Super excited to work with these folks! Also dinner was KILLER we had the fried green tomatoes, a beesting (kolsch with st. germaine, tea, and orange), a moselle biscuit (collard green, egg and fried chicken), and the chicken fried steak special with corn. It was an insane amount of food but so delicious! Will definitely be making this a regular stop!
13457	69	5.0	1	2014-09-24	My fiance and I had an impromptu date night in Williamsburg and happened upon this amazing spot. I'm not even sure where to begin. The decor is quaint and sweet. I later found out that John, one of the owners was responsible for the beautiful paintings. His wife, Treva(hope I'm not misspelling her name), the other owner and executive chef, was our server. She was great at recommending dishes for us and overall had such a pleasant disposition. The food was great and there are so many more things we plan to try the next time we go back. If you have a sweet tooth, the hummingbird cake and biscuit bread pudding are a MUST! John, Treva and their staff are a huge part of what make this place so great. You clearly see their passion and investment into cooking great food and creating a welcoming environment for all their patrons. Please check out this place if you want a filling-feel-good time!
13458	69	5.0	1	2014-09-23	The second we entered and were greeted we knew we made the right choice. We felt so home the whole time. Besides the amazing staff, the food was mind blowing. We both had kick started brunch which has changed my opinion of breakfast forever. The eggs were exactly as I asked for (same for my friend), the bacon was crispy and tasty making us to want so much more. And the biscuits, omg the biscuits... They are made of love and bring continuous smile to your face. We will definitely return! Also loved the design and atmosphere of the place. Can't wait to visit again! Hugs John and everyone! (See the pic of John amongst the pics, he is so lovely)
13459	69	5.0	1	2014-09-21	Great decor; the place feels straight out of Louisiana (or maybe Austin, given the Texas flag). The biscuits are awesome, and brunch comes with nice touches like fresh-squeezed orange juice.
13460	69	5.0	1	2014-09-20	I love this place, right around the corner and a wonderful place to take guests. Love the mini biscuits and the amazing in season jams. This is a gem not to be missed, laid back, reasonable portions and very reasonable prices. Also, the people that work there are so nice and have amazing service, something not to be overlooked in Williamsburg. I highly recommend!
13461	69	5.0	1	2014-09-15	Easily one of my favorite brunches this summer. This Texan family makes their own biscuits and jams in house and the result is delicious. I had their version of a croque madame on a bicuit with mushroom gravy, which was creamy but not too heavy. My meal was so satisfying. They serve great coffee and the staff and owners are extremely friendly and attentive. I'll probably go back for some fried chicken tomorrow!
9679	69	4.0	1	2014-09-15	Stumbled onto this place on a Sunday early afternoon, right after peak brunch time. Waited for about 2 min for a seat at the counter. This place is pleasantly busy but not frenetic. i hate those kind of brunch spots. However, because there wasn't much staff working here yet, everyone seemed just a bit stressed. the counter still had some jam which i put my hand into.  this place is still relatively new so i expect those kinks to be ironed out soon. after the jam, everything else was smooth. food was delicious. the fried chicken was the right size, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. i had the moselle, which was delicious. wasn't heavy on the hot sauce, fyi, if you're worried. biscuit was too salty for me and detracted from the rest of the flavors but had good consistency, i.e., didn't completely fall apart after the first bite. i tried the deviled eggs - they were good in the you can't fuck up deviled eggs kind of way. right now, it's just wine and beers. not sure if they're planning to expand to a full liquor license.
13462	69	5.0	1	2014-09-12	I've never ate in, only takeout, but the place looks adorable.  The Nettie and fried green tomatoes are my favorite but i've had a few other things on the menu and they've all been delicious. Quality food and fairly inexpensive.
13463	69	4.0	1	2014-09-10	"Another week, another Brooklyn brunch.  I've been to brunch more ties in the past month than I've been in the past two years (I like to sleep in on weekends I suppose).  But the team was in the mood for southern fixin's... and as the democratically appointed Yelper of the team, I selected the new kid on the block: Beehive Oven Biscuit Cafe.   Southern inspired cuisine??? Check.  Cozy nook of a dining area that BK has become so famous for???  Check.  Build your own biscuit sandwich options??? Hellz yea.  All these factors amounted to nods of approval from the team of brunchers I had dined with (half of whom I just met that morning/afternoon).  And despite the long waiting time (we had 7 in our party, and the fact that we were in Williamsburg for brunch didn't help none) we were all in good spirits, as we knew what we were getting ourselves in to.   Many opted for the build your own biscuit sandwich menu item... pretty self-explanatory huh???  You get a biscuit, choice of protein (fried chicken = ""duh""), and a slew of other toppings (including eggs, bacon, sausage gravy, and a bunch of other sauces).  Lo and behold, I was set to bike a few dozen miles after brunch (big surprise huh??), so that reality coupled with my inquisitive stomach resulted in me ordering two menu items... the build-a-biscuit and the ""bootstrap breakfast.""  The bootstrap was a typical bacon and eggs type of breakfast, and like any other staple (including burgers, pizza, etc...) it's a combo that's often replicated, tough to screw up, but even tougher to perfect.  Was this one the perfect combo???  No, but they didn't screw it up... and the addition of a biscuit with ""plum-ginger"" jam and some of the best grits I've had in some time. Some in the group ordered other of the menu-offered brunch fare in addition to the biscuit sandwiches, these included steak and eggs and shrimp and grits.  The ordering parties were happily content with their choices and the experience overall.  End of the day though, biscuits were the calling card, and they should keep hammering these biscuits home."
13464	69	5.0	1	2014-09-08	Admittedly, when I first heard about this place, I was surprised to see (as of this review) a sold 5 stars out of 27 reviews. Come on now. That seems almost unreal! Well, seeing is believing! Or, I suppose, eating is believing. I am a believer and am happy to put in another 5 star review for this fine establishment! It's located on a quiet corner in Williamsburg in a cozy space, and the beau and I lucked out by getting one of the last tables before a 12:30 p.m. brunch rush suddenly took over. A scant five minute wait for us, but a 30+ minute wait for everyone else. (Hehe! Luck was on our side!) Though, I don't blame the rush or the people wanting (and willingly waiting) to eat a meal here. What they have to offer is extraordinary. To start, a bright pink glass of perfectly sweetened prickly pear lemonade wet my whistle. Though I easily settled on one of the special biscuit sandwiches, the Nettie, the beau opted to make his own. Starting at $3 for the biscuit, you can add whatever you want from well more than a dozen items. He went simple with scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese, and I had to jab him a little for not being a little more inventive. ;-) (He's my better half. Of course I need to tease him!) The Nettie, on the other hand, is a piece of heaven: Hot biscuits sandwiched iceberg lettuce, thick bacon, a piece of fried chicken, and house-made buttermilk ranch dressing. I was told that I didn't breath at all; I just ate as the beau watched in both slight horror and utter amusement. IT. WAS. SO. GOOD. After inhaling, errrr, eating my sandwich, we were greeted by Treva, one of the owners and the executive chef of this restaurant. We both had a lovely chat with her. Her kindness and warmth made me feel bubbly and exuberant while talking to her. You can tell that this restaurant is her baby and she is an extremely proud mother. Upon looking at their website when I got home, I saw she was trained at ICE and is an established chef, food consultant, and food stylist (YES!). When she asked if we would be back, we both told her yes, and we meant it. The vibes, food, and hospitality of this restaurant are amazing, simply put.
13465	69	5.0	1	2014-09-07	Randomly found this place just wandering around. Had the Jezebel Wings, a chicken biscuit, and The Ruby (biscuit with fried green tomato, shrimp, and remoulade). Everything was phenomenal. The prickly pear lemonade was also amazing, and it's made on site, along with just about everything else there. The service and decor were just as comforting as the food. I'll definitely be back here a lot.
13466	69	5.0	1	2014-09-06	Just went in for a snack so we ordered the wings. So delicious! Sweet with a kick. After trying the wings we HAD to try more stuff! Also tried the biscuits with strawberry jam. Hands down... The best. Corn on the cob was good too... We had chocolate cake with biscof filling. Everything was just PERFECT. Great ambiance and great vibes.
13467	69	5.0	1	2014-08-30	Wandered past this place with my friend looking for breakfast/brunch. Just came back and thought I'd immediately inform yelp of this place. This place is adorable. Everyone was really friendly and the food was SO good! I had their special, the Texican. Corn bread biscuit, fried chicken, sausage gravy and a tomato salad. It was unique and delicious. Their menu includes a lot of Southern classics, some with a unique, updated twist. You can build your own biscuit too which is awesome. I was pleasantly surprised and I'll definitely be back.
13468	69	5.0	1	2014-08-21	I had my meal to go and even after taking it back to my house the biscuit was still fluffy and dense! Amazing food, truly. Even though Brooklyn has some phenomenal restaurants this small little (well designed) shop easily competes with the big names in the area. I had the ruby, which was awesome.....but the best item on the menu is the green fried tomatoes. My family is from south Carolina and Savannah and the green friend tomatoes are equally as good, if not better, than anything I've had in the south.
13469	69	5.0	1	2014-08-18	I love YELP for helping discover little gems like this place! My bf and I were in the area for the weekend. We wanted to try a new place for brunch on Sunday, so I looked up some suggestions for restaurants in the area. This southern girl was drawn to this spot, hoping that I wouldn't be disappointed as I often am with restaurants claiming to specialize in southern cuisine.  I was not. We sat at the bar and chatted with John, one of the owners, as we ate. John was friendly, asking us about ourselves and what brought us to the area, telling us about himself, and making sure we enjoyed our meal. We shared the fried green tomatoes served with remoulade sauce. It was delicious! I ordered the shrimp and grits--perfection.  Trust me...there aren't a lot of spots that get this dish right up here.  In fact, even though it's one of my favorite dishes when I'm down south, I've pretty much given up on ordering it when I'm anywhere else. But something about John's friendly banter made me feel like he wouldn't let me down.  It was awesome! As an added bonus, he gave us two delicious mimosas on the house because it was my bf's birthday weekend! We will most definitely be back during our next trip to NYC!
13470	69	5.0	1	2014-08-18	This place is Brooklyn's hidden gem! Let me preface this by informing you that I normally can't eat out due to having a lot of food allergies. But on special occasions I will let myself have a treat. So when I do cheat knowing that I will be miserable the next few days it better be worth it! And trust me Ive been to a ton of hyped places that were not worth it. After looking at a lot of places I decided to come here for my birthday. I brought a group of friends and even though it was a Saturday night without reservations we were able to be seated immediately. The food was amazing! I have found that it is hard to find good southern food in NY. But Beehive is the real deal. I had the fried okra, fried green tomatoes and the shrimp and grits. Plus a biscuit on the side. (Hey, I only get to do this once in awhile!) The biscuit was noms, the fried tomatoes were a little too spicy for me but my boyfriend loved them. The okra was good (maybe a lil overcooked, but still yummy and authentic). But the thing that blew my mind and made write this was their shrimp and grits. If you get this you will not regret it. The grits were creamy and velvety and the shrimp and sauce on top was extremely similar to Shrimp Creole, which is my favorite southern dish of all time. It reminded me so much of my grandmothers recipe. The shrimp were cooked to perfection and exploded with flavor. I was only a little annoyed that my friends kept trying to talk to me while I was trying to savor these bites. My friends had the build your own biscuits and all were in love. One got the chicken fried steak. This is a dish normally done quite different in the north than it is in the south, but theirs was the real deal. On top of all this the place was cute and the owner came out and was extremely attentive. They had had a little trouble with a chef not being able to show that day. Being a man down in the kitchen I can't imagine how much better it is on a regular day. I will definitely be back here for my next cheat day!!!! And I want to try that hummingbird cake next time!
13471	69	5.0	1	2014-08-08	I am not an expert on grits but when my Mississippi born highly fussy vegetarian business partner exalts over them they must be good. The food is homey and real the staff so good and the biscuit well delicious. Down home time for these Texas and South Carolina transplants.  Well deserved.
13472	69	5.0	1	2014-08-05	I almost don't want to give them a good review so they don't have 1.5 hour wait times like some other places but they deserve success.  We wandered in here last week and could not be more thrilled with how delicious everything was.  The chicken was crispy and moist.  The biscuits are so fluffy and buttery.  The jezebel sauce - YUM!  And then there is the buttermilk dressing.  Oh make sure to get the Prickly Pear Lemonade!!  Our server was attentive and friendly without being overbearing or annoying.
12958	69	4.0	1	2014-08-03	"Sometimes even the wrong train can take you to the right destination (The Lunchbox) ""So, how did you hear about us?"" John, one of the owners, asked me. ""Yelp. I read about you on yelp. The reviews were all glowing"". I responded. To be completely truthful, our intended destination was the nearby, insanely popular, fried chicken restaurant whose name rhymes with: ""Cries and Sighs"" (involuntary reactions from prospective clients on being told the wait time), but after hearing that the wait would be one and a half hours, I resorted to Plan B... as I had seen gushing reviews for Beehive Oven nearby. We walked over, and the wait here was only ten minutes. ""We're from Texas, and we're having fun with the concept"", said John to me when asked of the focus on being a ""Biscuit Café"". ""Biscuits are the vehicle, but we are introducing a number of variations that we think people will find interesting"". The Jezebel sauce was one such novelty for me. More like a Chutney than a sauce, the apple and pineapple preserves are given a slight kick by the horseradish sauce, but it's not pungent and helps one enjoy the chicken wings by not overpowering them. We got the Moselle (Fried Chicken, Collard Greens, Fried Egg, and Hot Sauce) and the Nettie (Fried Chicken, Iceberg wedge, buttermilk dressing, w/o bacon) sandwiches that both come with a side of Apple Raisin slaw. It would be fair to say that the sandwiches taste very good, but it's all about the biscuits... they are fantastic (5 stars). I don't think I've enjoyed any version of biscuits in NYC more than the one at Beehive Oven. Interestingly, there have been two (unintentionally) slightly different versions: one fluffier, while the other crispier but with an excellent bite... both tasted so good that you could eat them plain without the chicken and be ooh-ing and aah-ing...  As so happens ever too frequently in my food discoveries, I start focusing on a particular dish (lately Fried Chicken) and end up getting fascinated by something different... In this case: Biscuits... They are endlessly fascinating, for almost no two are alike! Some are cake-y, some are crumbly, some are fluffy, some crispy, some are like focaccia bread... it goes on and on, and one can't say that one version trumps others. But, Beehive exhibits a certain command and consistency in execution that deserves kudos and recognition. It's great to see a Smorgasburg alum graduate into the world of bricks and mortar, with distinction. There are a host of dessert options and we tried the Red Velvet cake (with Vanilla bean frosting) and the Texas Sheet Cake (with chocolate) that seemed less like a sheet cake and more like a fudgy brownie. The Sheet cake was marred by the sponge being uninteresting once one was done with the frosting... but the red velvet cake fared better in terms of frosting and cake, benefiting from the high turnover. ""Are you hoping to benefit from the spillover crowd at the nearby restaurant when they hear the wait time there?"" I asked John. ""Not really"", he replied. ""If we even got half of the number of customers they do, we wouldn't be able to handle it"". I agree with that assertion. The fact that they are getting regular patrons is helpful, but Beehive is definitely benefiting from not having a mass of customers beating down the door. Our server, delightfully  personable and with an endearing smile, was nevertheless hassled and had to be reminded for (1) small plates; (2) knives; (3) water (our glasses were empty); (4) bacon in the Nettie (when I had asked for it to be excluded); (5) the bill... Did I say she was cute and had an endearing smile? I'll give her the benefit of the doubt, and hope she lives up to my faith in coming visits. Coming back to the million dollar question of a comparison with the nearby restaurant: there were no pies (only cakes and puddings), but the thighs here were definitely better than the ones I could see over there... Though, I'm not talking about the feathered ones.... :)  You've gotta love summer in the City. (4.5 stars)"
13473	69	5.0	1	2014-07-29	This place is done right! Such goood foooood! Not the most options for veggie eaters but what they do have is out of this world! Give this little gem a try!
13474	69	5.0	1	2014-07-28	I'm so glad the other southern BBQ place was closed because it gave us a chance to hop over to Beehive. Southern food can go so wrong, especially with anything fried. But Beehive Oven understands the nuances of southern cuisine and delivers perfectly. You'll think you've bumped into grandma's kitchen through a wormhole in Williamsburg. Buttery, flaky, crispy, juicy, mouthwatering and delicious. Dripping with southern hospitality and featuring little touches like homemade lemonade and their special ranch dressing. I tried a little bit of their jam and it was unlike anything I've ever tasted. Listen, I ended up devouring what my kid didn't eat. I did not have a problem when he said he was done, more for momma! There's no kids menu, but they are very family friendly, and you can build your tot a biscuit sandwich for under $10. I will fall to my knees if a place THIS good comes to Montclair, Beehive fully lived up to their presentation and trendy setting by actually serving DELICIOUS food.
13475	69	5.0	1	2014-07-27	"If you are looking for legit Southern home-cooking, you've hit the jackpot here. I'm sure this place will make Adam Platts NY ""Where to Eat"" list within the first year they will be open. You know it's real Southern food when you don't have to add suger to your tea or salt to your grits. We ordered about 7 dishes and I was tempted to lick my plate. This place is incredible."
13476	69	5.0	1	2014-07-20	What a wonderful restaurant!  Down to Earth, welcoming and just damn tasty.  Anything involving fried chicken and biscuits should be delicious but this place takes it to another level.  We shared the fried green tomatoes and three fried chicken and biscuit sandwiches: nettie, moselle and the 'michelle' which had pimento cheese on it.  The owners brought us some jezebelle sauce to try which had an apple horseradish base and was delicious.  Highly recommended!!!
13477	69	5.0	1	2014-07-13	Whoah. This place is amazing. I walked to pies n thighs for dinner last night but it was packed, on my walk home I decided to try this place. I ordered a fried chicken and bacon biscuit sandwich plus the fried green tomatoes. Both were amazing. I think that was the best biscuit I have ever eaten, the fried green tomatoes were also probably the best I've ever had.  They also have good beer. I am going to be coming back often to sample the rest of the menu.
7997	69	5.0	1	2014-07-12	Awesome addition to the southern restaurant scene in Northern Brooklyn, and it's great to see a Smorgasburg stand rise to the next level of brick and mortar. Love the fact each biscuit is named after the owners grandmothers, and it's the little touches like these that make every guest feel at home. Definitely opt for anything with fried chicken and cheese, it's a time tested combo, and save room for red velvet cheesecake!
13478	69	5.0	1	2014-07-06	Amazing Southern, hospitality vibes in this S Williamsburg joint. Vegan-friendly as they prepared me a large salad and corn on the con. My date indulged in 2x biscuit sandwiches and was asking for more the next day. Recommend!
13479	69	5.0	1	2014-07-05	Beehive Oven is a lovely addition to the neighborhood. A charming and authentic experience with THE most delicious food. We had the Ruby, a gloriously divine culinary treat. The corn was a lovely sweet and savory side that should not be missed! The beer and wine selection should make this place everyone's local watering hole: beverages, biscuits and jezebel sauce, pure joy. Not to mention the lovely and genuine staff and owners. A truly personal dining experience. Go for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, stay for the at-home feeling and fantastic food.
13480	69	5.0	1	2014-07-04	Walked in here on a rainy 4th of July. Pleasant well lit atmosphere, southern oldies playing on the speakers, waitstaff is a mother daughter combo, friendly texan vibe. Ordered a fried chicken biscuit with fried green tomatoes and ranch and bacon with a prickly pear lemonade. Food came quickly and was eaten even quicker. Breading on the chicken was flavorful and the meat was very tender. The biscuit was flaky, the ranch certainly not from the bottle. great slaw as well. I will be back for sure!
13481	69	5.0	1	2014-06-29	This place is soo cute! Southern country decor in Brooklyn! Our waiter Nicholas started us off with the complimentary crudite platter that we just nibbled on at first, but  the homemade ranch dipping sauce was so good, i wanted morel!  I had the biscuit with chicken, collard greens and an egg, washed that down with the pear lemonade.  Very delicious and flavorful.  The staff was friendly, the owner John stopped to talk to us.  Great Sunday brunch, will be back.
13482	69	5.0	1	2014-06-29	After trying the food at Smorgasburg, I knew I had to stop in to the restaurant. As soon as you walk in the door, you feel welcome. I sat at the bar to place an order to go. Jon, one of the owners immediately greeted me and was so helpful and answered all my questions about the menu. Fried chicken biscuit with the jezebel sauce...amazing. Ordered the mini biscuits-HOMEMADE peach jam...so incredibly delicious. Loved my fried green tomatoes too-definitely will be back for sure(the red velvet cake looks soooo good) GO!!
13483	69	5.0	1	2014-06-22	This place is amazing! Everyone is super nice and the food is great.  I got the Nettie and it was the most glorious combination of fried chicken, bacon, and biscuit I've ever eaten.
13484	69	5.0	1	2014-06-17	Come for the fluffy biscuits, stay for the fried green tomatoes, and order the picnic platter for the group. A cozy, friendly place with a great atmosphere.
13485	69	5.0	1	2014-06-13	Great food - I only had a biscuit with bacon and fried chicken, but it was massively delicious.  Can't wait to try the red velvet cake. Wonderful atmosphere - Beautiful decor, fun, airy, colorful, with lots of beautiful wood.  Tables are wooden with bright, colorful, happiness-inducing washes, but not loud or garishly colorful.  Very skillfully handled.  Great benches too.  I thoroughly enjoyed soaking up all the furnishings.  Soft, luminous light when we were there around noon, I felt like I was in a food or architecture magazine.  Very comfortably spaced seating too, not cramped together like a lot of places in the area.   Affable owners -  John and Treva chatted us up from the bar for a good while about Texas, wildfire photography, and chicken fried steak.  Super friendly people, as was our waitress.  Just the kind of people I would want in a neighborhood restaurant. Really glad they're in the neighborhood!  It's a total day-brightener!
13486	69	5.0	1	2014-06-07	We loved it. Chicken pie is a must, shrimp and Cajun grits was delicious. Nice atmosphere, the owner is a gem.
13487	69	5.0	1	2014-06-04	Great new addition to the neighborhood! Homey vibe, welcoming people and delicious food. I love the fried green tomatoes and the Nettie sandwich and red velvet cake. The coffee is serious if you need a boost and lemonade not too sweet or tart- just perfect. All of the condiments are amazing which may seem like a weird thing to get excited about but try them! Jezebel especially.
13488	4531	5.0	-1	2014-12-06	Excellent food, service and ambiance! Great wine list. I got the eggs Benedict and the brochette. Delicious. I'll come back! Thanks!
13489	4531	5.0	-1	2014-10-09	great tasting food, and I love the grape leaves! the hummus is great too, and the service is friendly. A nice place to bring a date.
13490	4531	4.0	1	2015-01-05	Went to Balzem with a boisterous group of friends for our annual holiday dinner.  Loved the scene - cozy and festive, and just the right size, not too small.  Fair warning, they don't serve liquor, only beer and wine, but that was perfectly fine with us. We shared the cold mezze taster and brochette platter.  Both were delicious!  Mushroom/truffle oil pizza was also amazing.  You can't really go wrong with any of the mezzes, and we especially liked that the menu is very vegetarian friendly.  Favorites were stuffed peppers, roasted eggplant and grilled portabella. I'm definitely keeping this place bookmarked.  Low lit setting makes it good for dates, but also ideal for small groups of friends too.  Lastly, bonus points for being in a pretty cool part of Nolita with great bars and shops nearby.
13491	4531	3.0	1	2014-12-19	Went for business lunch. Food good. Service a bit strange as when we came in we were seated right next to the only other party in the restaurant. We asked to move and there was no problem with it. Food took about 30 minutes to come out. Was originally told no french fries about 20 min after ordering but then they ended up coming out with the food and tasted good.
13492	4531	3.0	1	2014-12-15	Came here with a group of girlfriends for a birthday - there was one hiccup as the table waited ~5-10 minutes for the last person's plate to come out.  Other than that, service was great!   I had the meatballs (OK but not great), the hummus plate (not my kind of hummus, but that's totally subjective), the flatbread (good!) and the zucchini pancakes (good but soggy) We had two chocolate desserts - a molten lava cake and some kind of tall chocolate cake slice.  Both were pretty good! Overall it didn't blow me away, but I enjoyed it.
13493	4531	4.0	1	2014-12-11	Lovely ambience, fantastic tapas, great wine selection, and charming staff! This is a great neighborhood spot that is wafting with wonderful energy. Don't miss out on the roasted eggplant and sautéed spinach - they go great together. And make sure you chat with the owner(s) - they are welcoming and have a great sense or humor!
13494	4531	2.0	1	2014-12-09	WAYYY overpriced for what it was... the spot is lovely, very romantic and cute, probably better for a glass of wine and an appetizer. but definitely NOT for a dinner... went with a group of friends for an after work dinner and wine.. the food was terribly mediocre, and the entree portions were way too small for the price. ended up leaving hungry and with a big hole in our pocket! totally NOT worth it...
13495	4531	2.0	1	2014-12-06	Bad service, club-like atmosphere. Came here on a Friday night for a 830 reservation and it was beyond crowded and loud. The hostess unapologetically still hadn't seated us at 840, even though there had been a couple open tables since we walked in, so we left and went to nearby Emporio which had amazing food and had fantastic service. Was pleased to get out of the boozy brunch-like atmosphere of Balzem.
8919	4531	5.0	1	2014-12-04	This is a great date spot, beautiful ambiance, attentive and friendly staff. Ahem, good looking too. Came here on a Wednesday night for late dinner and drinks. At 10pm, the place still had a few tables and the vibe was really chill, cozy and welcoming. Good deep house playing also helps. I arrive early and didn't want to wait outside as it was blustering cold. I walked in and was greeted by a very handsome staff. He was friendly and sat me right up close to the bar. I order a Cuvee bubbly to get the warmth going. I sit at the bar for about 20 minutes waiting for the lust of my life. And while I waited, I got to chat up the staff. Everyone that works here is European, no Americans. The handsome Italian with insanely sick dimples was very kind to also charge my phone. Now that is good service. And extremely mesmerizing eye candy. My date arrives and we are moved to a table that faces the front of the restaurant. We order up a few draft beers and decided on the mezze platter ($35) which includes hummus, stuffed grape leaves, spicy feta dip, roasted eggplant and artichoke dip. This was a nice serving size for 2 and it came with plenty of pita bread. We also ordered the shrimp mezze ($15). Everything was excellent albeit a bit pricy. But remember, you are in Nolita. You're paying their rent also and feeding those models. I was told that on the weekends, it gets pretty lively and they kick up the deep house music a bit. I will definitely be back to ogle the hot staff, shake my booty a bit, nosh on some yummy tapas, and flirt to my heart's content.
13496	4531	4.0	1	2014-12-01	Had a really great dinner here with a big group of friends. Lively music, delicious food - especially the pesto pasta and the Mediterranean mezzes. However, I ordered delivery a few weeks later and got a very sad version of the pesto pasta :( I'll stick to eating in-house.
13497	4531	4.0	1	2014-12-01	I love the Ratatouille, portobello burger, lentil soup (small for $5 though) and balzem hummus.   I love your food and delivery time.  HOWEVER, it does fricking suck to know that you have separate prices and options on your own lunch menu that you keep including with my lunches.  It is simply easier to order through grubhub.  So I suggest you lower the prices and stop making me spend $20 on lunch just to meet the min.  Because nothing else is below $5...grrrrrr. I really do understand from a business perspective.  But there is the option to simply offer the people that order directly from your site a coupon. STOP RUBBING IT IN MY FACE THAT I OVER PAID - SHEESH. Also please have an option to get a salad instead of fries.  :) Thanks.
13498	4531	3.0	1	2014-11-24	Came here post happy hour to get some food. We ended up also having a bunch of glasses of a great Malbec and finishing a bottle and half or so. I believe it was on the happy hour menu and although I don't remember the exact cost, it was definitely a great deal as the bill at the end was not bad at all for the price we paid. We sat at the counter type thing and the service was great- our glasses were never empty for long! I give them 3 stars because I was not a huge fan of the food I tried. It could definitely be that i ordered the wrong thing though. I got the manti- beef yogurt with yogurt and herbs. I thought they added a little too much yogurt and it actually took away from the dish and was not too impressed by the dumplings either. Mostly, I just wished my food had a little more flavor. For $14, the dish was a bit disappointing. I would not rule out coming back, but would definitely not recommend the dish I ordered.
13499	4531	5.0	1	2014-11-24	Awesome location, atmosphere, food, and service.  Probably the best burger I've had in years.  Definitely coming back.
13500	4531	5.0	1	2014-11-23	Was here last night, a very casual and intimate Saturday night dinner. And I really enjoyed it and satisfied. I have Quinoa, Octopus tapa, and Brochette Platter for 2 as our entree, which is a combination of Lamb, Stake and Chicken. We also had red wine with our dinner. Everything is amazing including service, I can't wait to come back try something else. In fact, I believe there are many good unique places it's worth to try in downtown area. Such as LES, Nolita, village area. Balzem is definitely one of them.
13501	4531	5.0	1	2014-11-20	Very cute place with a large selection of Mediterranean dishes,  I had the $12 soup and sandwich for lunch. You can't beat that. Cool place.
13502	4531	5.0	1	2014-11-17	Had a wonderful experience celebrating a friend's birthday at Balzem. The interior of the space is quite charming with exposed brick and huge windows on the storefront. We were lucky enough to sit in a corner with a window and enjoyed some fine people watching on Mott St. The food here was exceptional. We started off with some potato and shrimp appetizers which were more than enough to share for 2 people. For my entree I went with the lamb chops. Although a bit small, they were cooked excellently and the potato side + the arugula salad that came with the meal certainly filled me up. We paired our meal with 2 bottles of reasonably price Merlot. This is an absolute great find in a fun neighborhood. If you are looking for a nice place to go out or a perfect date spot head into Balzem. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone. Eat well New York!
13503	4531	5.0	1	2014-11-16	Artichoke dip is a must try for everyone! Great atmosphere, very friendly staff. Perfect for a date or a place to relax with girls!
13504	4531	5.0	1	2014-11-14	"As my husband just said when I asked him how many stars, ""I'm fine with five!"" Yummy start to finish with gracious attention from the waiter who let me try the wine before deciding. Fresh, delicious and I would frequent if I lived nearby. All good!"
13505	4531	5.0	1	2014-11-14	Decorated like an old wine cellar with rustic lighting and brick walls, balzem was a solid experience for my first time in NYC. The food here is great from the dolmas to the shrimp casserole. The staff is great attentive and makes great recommendations. If you're  ever in the Nolita area, check it out.
13506	4531	5.0	1	2014-11-10	A great atmosphere!  Great food!  Spicy Feta dip and grape leavers were fantastic!  A bit of a tight squeeze, but totally worth it to go and grab dinner!
13507	4531	2.0	1	2014-11-07	Good atmosphere, looks very nice with the exposed brick walls and wooden shelves.  The place is small so expect to be cramped in certain areas or have your chair knocked into throughout the night.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  They are more wine and drink friendly because their menu for beverages are several pages, whereas the food is only one page.  With that note, I didn't expect to walk out full, and I was right.   I came here with a bunch of friends for dinner and the food was decent at best.  I tried their lamb chops and I felt like it was missing half of the chops to be a full plate.  This lamb must've died starving to be so meatless.  To add insult to injury, the lamb chops I did have were too salty, then the salad was just as salty, and even the potato was salty.  Talk about overcompensating the lack of actual flavor with salt.  The appetizers were a bit better, the meatball was nothing special but at least it wasn't salty. Portions are very small for what you pay.  Their menu doesn't change much from lunch to dinner so the bulk of their options don't vary.  If my lamb chop, for dinner, cost 21 dollars and I had so little, can I assume that the lunch, which is 14 dollars, will have nothing but a bone? I see this place as a bar more than a restaurant.  If you wanted to charge me this much at least give me better food.  This is one of those places that looks good, but doesn't taste good, which is too bad because my friend wanted to try this place so much and it was a letdown.
13508	4531	3.0	1	2014-11-01	"Good, yes. Exceptional, no. Expensive for what you get. Especially ordering in, when the atmosphere doesn't seduce you. I just spent almost $40 on a little more than one meal. The hummus is fine, nothing extra special. So is the baba ganoush. But $8 each? Portion was more like $5 each. And listing the ""Roasted eggplant""  to sound like a nice, hot veggie, when what comes is a cold dollop of baba ganoush, sucked. Stuffed grape leaves were just ok. Everything read much more delicious than it tasted. All the ingredients were inexpensive, but man they up charged for it. Must be the Nolita rent."
13509	4531	5.0	1	2014-10-27	Balzem was a new gem that I found! Food was very clean and loaded with flavor. The service was on point as the waiter was very attentive. The entire vibe of the restaurant was great- love a smaller restaurant with a warm inviting setting. This will definitely be added to my list of go to affordable yet delicious eats.
13510	4531	3.0	1	2014-10-26	This place is average.  I came here as a party of 11 for my birthday.  We got the center table which meant that the waiters were bumping into us all night, trying to squeeze past.  The service was not very good.  Nor was it very personable.  No one ever told us if there were any specials, or made any suggestions on what to order, or how many small plates would suffice.  The food itself was mostly good, but nothing memorable.  They serve only beer and wine, no hard liquor.  I did like the look of the place, and it was just a few blocks away from a great speakeasy, downstairs from Jacques 1534 at 20 Prince Street.
13511	4531	5.0	1	2014-10-18	A wonderful atmosphere and neighborhood. The staff is friendly, the food is absolutely amazing especially the spinach artichoke dip with pita. Outstanding wine selection with a homey vibe. Very relaxing and comforting. Out of all my experiences in Balzem, each and every one is more amazing then the next. Wine Beer Exceptional service   Who can ask for more!
13512	4531	1.0	1	2014-10-18	It's like a Jersey shore episode in this place. Weak food. Over priced and just plain sleazy. Zucchini cakes were...meh and the lamb was over cooked. Felt like a scene and not a place to get good food. Why does this place have such a high rating?
13513	4531	5.0	1	2014-10-05	We've been ordering delivery from here at work almost every day.  The food is amazing and spot on.  Brazino was perfectly seasoned and crisp.  The potatoes gratin was heavenly.  Their hummus had a nice spicy tartness to it.  I heartily recommend this place.
13514	4531	5.0	1	2014-09-21	Dinner here for the 3rd time this week. Incredible food, ambience and a wonderful staff - especially the guy with long hair, he went out of his way to make this evening special for me and my girlfriends. An amazing addition to the neighborhood I highly recommend it.  Will be back on a regular. Everyone needs to go!!
13515	4531	5.0	1	2014-09-10	A wonderful neighborhood spot! The ambiance is cozy with a laid back air which makes you want to sit and savor the experience. Staff was incredible and the food was delish! My husband and I had an absolutely wonderful experience at dinner! Food was flavorful and delicious, here is what we had: - Hummus- Hummus with a little twist of herbs and parsley aka full of flavor and not just your average bland hummus! Comes with warm soft pita :) - Zucchini pancakes- I'm a sucker for zucchini pancakes and these were no exception, soft with a little crispness and lots of flavor! - Stuffed grape leaves- normally not a fan of dolmas but I actually liked these! The rice was flavorful with pine nuts and currants making it nutty and sweet at the same time! - Phyllo rolls- cheesey crunchy goodness...enough said - Branzini ceviche- fresh, citrusy, yum! - Chicken Brochette- chicken kebab was grilled perfectly, juicy and flavorful, right on point! - Chocolate cake- ok so this was absolutely delicious, would come back just for this! The service here was incredible with the staff bringing us two appetizers on the house and even refilling our wine glasses without any charge....now that is what you call customer service. The staff at Balzem really went out of their way to make us feel special and we had a truly memorable night because of that. So if you're looking for a great new spot to try, Balzem is the place! Great atmosphere, fabulous service and delicious food, what else can one ask for :) I know we will definitely be coming back!
13516	4531	5.0	1	2014-09-08	Absolutely amazing place.   Chefs Juan food is delicious !!!!! Staff is very friendly and professional.  Makes you feel like home.... Always want to come back It's my home away from home..... Me and my bf love to come here, chef always accommodates us so perfectly !!! He's awesome
13517	4531	5.0	1	2014-09-04	Incredible food, had the grilled chicken for lunch. Only $10, which incredible french fries and bread that was to die for. The overall ambiance of Balzem is also on point. Very rustic, yet elegant.
13518	4531	2.0	1	2014-09-03	Average food, high prices, incompetent service.
13519	4531	5.0	1	2014-08-29	Great lunch spot. Light fare. Good service. Recommend if in the mood for an easy going outing.
13520	4531	3.0	1	2014-08-22	wasn't blown away. came here for my birthday dinner and had a great time (but again wasn't blown away by the food) what we had: - hummus balzem: good hummus. ask for more pita so you can savor every last bit. - branzini ceviche: delicious! wish the portions were bigger (or we ordered more) - brochette platter (lamb, steak, chicken): i hate to admit it but it was hard to tell the difference between the lamb and beef. meats were cooked to perfection though but lacked flavor. i drowned the meats with the chimichurri sauce it came with and had to ask for a sauce refill cause i needed more flavor to finish my meal - potato gratin: this came with the platters we ordered. delicious! delicious! delicious! i wanted to lick the plate btw great wine selection.
13521	4531	4.0	1	2014-08-11	Lovely atmosphere, great service! I went with my husband and we had a great time, waiters were very caring and offered us some good advice on wines. We shared some appetizers, one main dish and dessert. I loved the zucchini pancakes and the ratatouille. The shrimp casserole was really good but a bit to heavy for my taste, a bit too oily. The chocolate and raspberry cake was very nice.   The menu has so many inviting options that is hard to choose what to order :) I will come back again!
13522	4531	4.0	1	2014-08-09	first time i went there, seems a nice place. reasonable prices and the food was good. i surely will go back again
13523	4531	5.0	1	2014-08-09	Not only does this place have phenomenal ambiance and decor, but the food and service are impeccable. One of my new favorite date spots.
13524	4531	3.0	1	2014-07-31	Delicious food, but be wary of the french-looking wild haired gentleman who sits behind the bar not serving drinks and looking aloof. In between soulful gazes into the distance, he occasionally does laps of the restaurant, looking suave and important, but don't be fooled. He is not your waiter, and will bluntly remind you of that if you mistakenly think he is because your waiter has disappeared for an extended period of time. At first glance, we assumed he was the host, but rejected that hypothesis after he greeted diners with casual shrugs as the entered the restaurant.
13525	4531	5.0	1	2014-07-25	Excellent evening, delicious Mediterranean food with comfortable diner friendly staff. I would be a regular here if NYC was my home.
13526	4531	4.0	1	2014-07-17	I popped in at Balzem for a quick lunch. Their Ribeye sandwich was great, prices for wine and food spot on. On a good day I could sit by the terrace. Just great. Free Wifi a plus.
13527	4531	4.0	1	2014-07-13	Great atmosphere with a wine bar type feel. Service was great and food was also very good. Make reservations for bigger groups, as the place is quite small. Would definitely return here!
13528	4531	5.0	1	2014-07-13	Best food, music, drink selection and atmosphere in soho. Always the best at balzem. Thanks guys!!!
13529	4531	2.0	1	2014-07-01	Lazy to write a long descriptive review, but in a nutshell, yawn. Went with a veg friend and ordered the Zucchini Pancakes (under-seasoned), Quinoa Salad (kept looking for the quinoa in there!) Plyllo Rolls (wayyyy too salty) & Roasted Eggplant (C'mon, this is an easy one to get right!). Simple stuff but rather unimpressive. Sad, for some reason I had expected much more from this spot. Maybe I'll go back to give them another chance on the meats....
13530	4531	3.0	1	2014-06-27	Great ambiance.  The food was above average and reasonable priced.  We enjoyed the zucchini pancakes (although a bit rich) and the hummus was superb.  The burrata was a bit of a disappointment in that it was more solid and like mozzarella than burrata and felt similar to what you'd get at the grocery store.  The favorite dish was the chicken farci, which had spinach inside and was moist and well done.
13531	4531	4.0	1	2014-06-14	Nice spot for lunch on a quiet section of Mott St. Good small plates, wines by the glass, friendly service and a nice atmosphere.
12883	4531	4.0	1	2014-06-14	My friend that lives nearby Balzem always informs me of the new restaurants in my 'hood so we can add them to our list and check them out. This place was incredibly cute. It made me really miss Israel with all of the accents and Hebrew speaking. We really enjoyed our food and shared a bunch of salads, hummus, veggies. It was the perfect amount of food that we weren't still hungry but we weren't overly full. I look forward to coming back.
5482	4531	5.0	1	2014-06-12	Great neighborhood gem found! I hope they're here to stay! Been eyeing this place since they've opened and was a little skeptical to try but decided to given their great reviews. The zucchini pancakes were awesome, lightly crunchy on the outside and a healthy mushy center. The hummus was really good too, full of spices. It's not the usual hummus where it sits in a bed of olive oil. The octopus was just perfect and tender to the bite. Ribeye was great, steak was great. The chocolate raspberry cake was delicious with its rich chocolate frosting. The portions are good here too. I have no complaints! We saw the table next to us order the stuffed peppers...it looked delicious, will definitely order that next time. Service is also very good. Will definitely be coming back!
5533	4531	5.0	1	2014-06-07	Love this place! Its very cozy and comfortable, reinforced by great service. I went with a group and tried a little of everything... Mediterranean at its best!
13532	4531	5.0	1	2014-06-07	Fabulous restaurant. Food is delicious and prices are very reasonable. I will definitely go back.
13533	4531	5.0	1	2014-05-30	Great addition to my neighbourhood, welcome Balzem! Delicious food, excellent wines, and impressive playlists.
13534	4531	5.0	1	2014-05-18	Very relaxed ambiance and very reasonably priced food/wine. The restaurant opened only two weeks ago, so it is not too hard to get a last minute reservation. We got the zucchini pancake, hummus, lamb brochette and lamb chops. The food was decent (hummus was really good). Would definitely recommend it!
13535	4531	5.0	1	2014-05-14	Came in last week for a late lunch and everything was delicious!!! Can't wait to try dinner.
13536	4531	5.0	1	2014-05-05	Well designed interior with a cool vibe. The food is delicious and I highly recommend the zucchini cakes. Perfection! The music alone is reason to go, well curated playlists for cool downtown dining. Sit back and enjoy a glass of wine!
13537	4531	5.0	1	2014-05-01	Beautiful interior, great food, relaxing music 5+. Service on level with restaurants in the neigbourhood. Very nice new addition to restaurant mix on Mott street. Definitely will visit again..
13538	71	1.0	-1	2014-02-11	"The food is absolutely 5 stars and the waitstaff absolutely friendly & accommodating. Wish I could say the same about the manager. We had booked and prepaid for a large dinner party (approx. 20 people) at Pig and Khao. We were celebrating a birthday and may have been a little rambunctious. So when someone dining at another table shouted over to our party to ""shut up!"" I was a little disappointed at how the manager handled the situation, almost in favor of the guest that told us to 'shut up.' I believe one of our dinner guests even caught the head chef roll an eye at our dinner party when we were singing Happy Birthday.  I guess Pig and Khao is just a little too cool for big birthday parties that patron them with a large bill in the middle of the week. If that is the case, then do not take such a large dinner reservation. A large majority of our party was Filipino themselves and excited to see Filipino cuisine to made well and enjoyed by people who normally would not. This place could be more authentic in attitude."
13539	71	1.0	-1	2014-01-08	Really bad.  The flavor profiles of the food are incredibly erratic or not present at all.  The wine selection is poor and the definitely served me a glass that was at least 2 days old.  Also, it's super gross to see their cocktail rinse bucket front and center in the window as you walk in.  Rearrange the bar guys.   In addition, I know that people smoke, but it's really gross to watch your servers (all but one at the same time) go outside to take a cigarette break with the woman who's been in the kitchen all night (I would call her the chef or cook, but she wasn't wearing any chef gear and didn't have her hair covered even though she was over the grill the entire time).  The all went out front together, smoked, and then came back in and started serving again.  I'm hoping they washed their hands but I wasn't paying that close attention.  It seems more like a group hang out than a restaurant.  The music didn't help that vibe either.  If I'm not mistaken music is supposed to be ambiance right?  I really don't need your personal preference shoved down my throat and I get some of the big name chefs like to 'play what they would listen to in the kitchen' but honestly are you a big name chef?  Customer service should be number one.
13540	71	1.0	-1	2013-07-08	How about a zero star.... I had terrible bathroom problems.  Visiting from Cali where REAL Filipino food can be appreciated.  Used the bathroom and when I walked in I saw 3 tiny brown longated creatures with about 6-8 legs (ROACHES) scurried into holes big enough to fit a large booger.  So I can't imagine what the kitchen looks like at 3am.   If any of you New Yorkers comes to San Francisco....please Yelp Filipino cruisines for you will have plenty to choose from.
13541	71	1.0	-1	2013-01-25	"I would give it no stars, but Yelp won't let me.  Customer service here is unprofessional.  After reading the following blog, thanks to yelper William B., now I know why service is lacking here beginning with management.  blogs.villagevoice.com/f… We were a party of 6 attempting to celebrate a friend's birthday here Friday evening based on a friend's positive review.  Reservations are not accepted but we were told to leave a phone number when we arrived with all guests present for a table.  We were told the wait for the table would be 45 minutes to an hour.  My friends and I decided to wait for the phone call at the bar across the street.  Well, 1.5 hrs passed but no phone call.  We sent a friend over and was told the table will be ready in 10 minutes.  At the time, I decided to wait at the restaurant for the table.  A staff member who worked the front in a red shirt and red cap gave me a menu to view while I waited. When a table became available it was offered to another group of people who were there after us.  But that was not the big issue, because another table became available shortly after that.  The table closest to the entrance on a very cold night of degrees in the teens was offered to us.  About 5 minutes after we were seated a table a bit further away from the entrance became available and I asked the host (I presume), bald guy in a white tee, if we were able to move over.  This is the big issue. The host was nasty!  He said, ""How could I do that?  First you said you were a party of 6, now you show up with 7.""  I would think other establishments would be grateful.  Wouldn't more people mean more money for them?  I said, ""It's not like you did anything special, you gave us the same table but added a chair.""  We waited 2 hours for this table.  This staff member continued with the same arrogant nastiness.  When a member in our group was fed up with his tone, he decided to get up to leave.  Suddenly, we were physically pushed out.  The rush almost hurt a pregnant guest with 2 others on the floor.  To add insult to injury, the staff threatened to call the police and the same host/staff member said, ""No more Asians.""  That's not so funny, because this establishment is serving Asian cuisine.  Here is my assumption based on this very negative dining experience, it seems this host/staff member made negative assumptions about Asians prior to our arrival and treated us in this fashion. We never got to order so this review is based solely on customer service.  Pig and Khao, you failed on customer service.  It was unprofessional, unfriendly, and I was purely disgusted.  I will not revisit this establishment.  Spend your hard earned money elsewhere!"
13542	71	2.0	-1	2014-05-31	I have been to Pig and Khao twice, the first time I had the tasting menu and it was phenomenal. I liked it so much that when I had friends from LA in town I made a reservation to take them here. On a positive note, most of the food was great. We loved the coconut rice, green mango salad, and shan noodles. However, the service was so bad that I was embarassed that I brought my friends here. We were seated toward the front of the restaurant, and it was Memorial Day weekend, so perhaps our table was forgotten about, or it was a smaller staff-but we sat at our table for 20 minutes being ignored while waitresses passed us. It was clear that we needed to be helped, we had our menus closed and we had been there quite awhile. We finally flagged down the hostess who took our orders very quickly, was not very helpful with our questions, and it was clear she did not want to serve us. It took another 20 minutes for us to get our drinks, and once we had finished those no one came around to ask us if we wanted another. The entire experience we had no waiter or waitress and had to keep flagging people down to help us. In addition, the hostess (not waitress) told us that she recommended 5-7 dishes for 4 girls. We ordered 5 and thankfully did not order more. The portion sizes are way too big to recommend that many dishes, and we only finished half of our meal. I really want to love this restaurant, but there are too many choices in New York for me to consider going back, after my second experience there.
13543	71	2.0	-1	2013-11-02	First off, the lady at the front wasn't pleasant at all.  I had thought that my reservation was at 730pm but when I got there at 729pm...the lady out in the front..instead of greeting us was like...'I was one minute away from giving your table away!'!! I was like why? im on time...shes like you're reservation is for 715pm...ok so I apologized that I thought my reservation for 730...and anyway...why must she be so damn rude? and besides...they had FIVE other tables OPENED...with NOONE sitting on it!! ugh. anyway, back to the food. HEART ATTACK!!!  everyone raves about the sizzling sisig--but let me tell you...it was ALL FAT. Was grossed out while eating it... couldnt even finish the dish. The khao soi was eh...Lastly, we have the grilled pork jowl which was really really tasty...! Overall, a very meh experience.
13544	71	3.0	-1	2013-06-08	IF it was not so expensive, I would have given it another star.  With tax and tip, my bill was 185 for two of us.  If I spend this much, I would like a little more finesse, a little better service...and that x factor.  Food was ok.  We got completely porked out by our last course.   Needless to say, one of the bettr filipino experiences I have had recently.
13545	71	4.0	-1	2013-10-07	Sisig, Khao Soy, coconut rice all worthy dishes.  Swirling the raw egg in with the fried pork is kind of fun.  Only complaint is that the Khao is at least moderately spicy and I wish they had a milder option as the sauce is delicious.  The fried chicken is good, but there's about 2x more fried skin than chicken and I wasn't in the mood to just eat fried skin.  Only other mention is that they serve a lot of food.  We shared 3 small plates and a side for 2 people and it was PLENTY!  Eclectic group of cocktails with a low maintenance beer selection.  Beat expectations.
13546	71	4.0	-1	2013-07-13	Enjoyed the food immensely!!  Generous portions and friendly staff.  The music was a bit loud, difficult to carry a conversation.
13547	71	4.0	-1	2013-05-19	This food at Pig and Khao is simply AMAZING! We stumbled across it one evening exploring the LES. It's a cute little place and it seemed to have a good vibe. It took us a while to get service when we sat down and only did so after flagging the busboy down and asking him to get our server. However we will overlook this as the food was just that damn good! We ordered a bunch of small plates which were all excellent. I would highly recommend the crispy red curry and quail adobo. Oh and they have one of my favorite beers-hitachino white nest ale-in a large format...just heaven! Will def go out of my way to visit soon again!
13548	71	4.0	-1	2012-11-05	Let me start by saying that I have never before had Philippino food. It was absolutely delicious. My favorite dishes were the pork jowl and the whole fish curry.  I also really liked the coconut rice. The waiters were really friendly and accommodating. Overall a great experience.
13549	71	5.0	-1	2014-10-02	Pig and Khao is hands-down my number one favorite brunch (drunch) place in all of New York City. I have brought so many of my friends here throughout the years, and I swear there was a time during the summer that we were there religiously every Saturday morning to enjoy delicious food, bottomless drinks, and general debauchery. I even convinced one of my best friends to have her engagement party here because she was blown away with the food, drinks, and venue! The Food: Everything on the brunch menu is just flawless. I love the Filipino/Thai influence, with some Spanish elements. My favorites are the longonissa (sausage) paired with cucumber salad and garlic rice, along with the sizzling sisig and steak and eggs. For my friend's engagement party, we also tried the brioche French toast, and while seemingly out of place, it was fabulous. But seriously, the longonissa and garlic rice (with egg!) is just like how mom made it back at home in the far-off land of Los Angeles, California. The Drinks: Endless Mimosas. $15. What else can I say? If you're feeling frisky, try the seasonal Watermelon Mimosas and Lychee Mimosas. If you're a stickler for classics, then the Mango Mimosa won't hurt. Orange is boring, anyway. The Service: I've had delightful experiences with the staff there every time I've been (easily more than 15 times this past year). Additionally, during one of my drunken brunches, I ran into the owner, Chef Leah Cohen (a contestant from Top Chef), and spoke with her for a bit. She was very polite and lovely, ignoring the fact that I was happily drunk and telling her how much I loved her on Top Chef/loved the restaurant. The Venue: Although the location is basically Brooklyn (it's minutes away from the Williamsburg Bridge - Manhattan side), I can't complain. The paintings on the wall are great, the atmosphere is relaxing and not uptight, and the music they play is on point (early 90s rap/R&B). Seriously, nothing to complain about here. Although I haven't been in a month, I will be heading back soon. I cannot lie when I say that this is my go-to place for brunch on the weekends. Cannot wait to try their dinner soon! TIP: If you're like me and bring crowds of people with you, it's best that you bring CASH. While they will split your checks here with credit card, it will save you time to just divvy everything up with cash.
13550	71	5.0	-1	2013-10-14	When in NY it is a must that you try this place . Food is outstanding, friendly service, price is fair, beautiful people...
13551	71	5.0	-1	2013-09-07	OUTSTANDING food and service. Stumbled upon this gem yesterday whilst cruising around LES. Not only is the food incredibly tasty, they have a fantastic beer menu to boot. The ribs..... WOW. They must be the best in the city. The waiters were really laid back, yet still wonderfully attentive. Loved the vibe in this place, will definitely be coming here again.
13552	71	5.0	-1	2013-06-23	Great brunch! Shared the sizzling sisig and the khao soi with the garlic fried rice. Both were delicious and the fried rice was the perfect side. The watermelon mimosa was my favorite of the bottomless mimosa options. Service was also great and I enjoyed watching the chefs in the open kitchen. Will definitely be back!
13553	71	5.0	-1	2013-05-16	I'm a bit late on the review but here we go. I have never had sizzling sisig before and we loved it so much we ordered it again. The taste and smells definitely reminded me of my travels in SE Asia. This place is for people who are open minded about food and are willing to be adventurous in their culinary journey. Don't just come in and cringe at the exotic food on the menu and order the mango salad because its the most mainstream ...go to the Olive Garden if you want that kind of food (there were a few of these when we went).
13554	71	5.0	-1	2013-04-04	While contemplating the menu the elderly filipino couple seated next to us gave us their recommendations and told us the food was really authentic. We listened. Suffice to say I could still feel the pork sitting in my belly the next morning. Oh and $1 beers (bud light) - tough to argue with the price and easy to throw back a couple with the meal. Will be eating here again.
13555	71	5.0	-1	2013-04-01	A relative new comer to the LES, we were itching to try out Pig and Khao with all of the great reviews it's been getting. On our walk over from the 6 train we had high hopes for this meal and we weren't let down.  Once we all arrived and sat at our table with a view of the open kitchen we were informed that there was a tasting menu available for the whole table. Both pairs of our double date went for that option without hesitation. An amuse bouche of tasty/salty sauce and a quail egg, and some beers for the guys and cocktails for the ladies (which could've been a bit boozier) was a good start.  The rest of the meal was a mix of salty and spicy that delighted the senses. Fried oysters, more quail egg, and some parts of the pig we wouldn't have normally touched with some one else's fork turned out to be absolutely fantastic.  While everything was delicious, the two highlights of the night were the sizzling sisig - an upscale version of corned beef hash, and the lamb ribs - tender bits of lamp perfectly spiced and fall-off-the-bone-delicious.  All in, the food and service were top notch, though the decor and bar left a little something to be desired. It is certainly on the list for off the beaten path spicy eats.  While Pig & Khao seems like a strange mix of different elements - almost take-out like decor, a self-service keg in the back garden, yet top notch food that you'd expect from an upscale restaurant, it all somehow works. @datenitenyc
13556	71	5.0	-1	2013-03-27	My boyfriend is Filipino (Pinoy) We ate here the other day and it was good! I havent really eaten too much filipino food before....so I cant really compare that much, but this was amazing! My boyfriend said it was just like home. The lechon was great! People were really nice. Really genuinely filipino place. We are definitely coming back to the place often! Oh and Halo Halo for desert!
13557	71	5.0	-1	2012-10-27	It's a good one!
13558	71	5.0	-1	2012-10-01	Great new addition to the neighborhood.  Authentic, sophisticated, flavorful food at the right price.  Love the backyard and the creative cocktails.  The Khao Soi and and Lamb Ribs were my favorite.  Those and the Fried Banana with Salty Caramel Ice Cream. Yum!!!
13559	71	4.0	1	2015-01-06	The Suckling Pig Feast was fantastic and a great value for the price.  Highly recommended as a large format/group dining experience.
13560	71	5.0	1	2015-01-05	moderate prices. so flavorful. ordered the octopus salad, kano soi and sirlion dish. all great flavors especially the octopus salad. it was cooked perfectly with a tangy and spicy taste. overall, a great dinner! will definitely come back here again.
13561	71	3.0	1	2015-01-04	Sizzling SigSig earned this restaurant its 3 stars. It is AMAZING. I don't eat much Filipino food, but this is the best I've had in the city so far. I ate with 4 other people family style and it worked out very very well. On top of the sigsig, pork belly adobo, mussels, baby back ribs, and the halo halo for dessert. For the most part, the food was very basic; it tasted a lot like traditional chinese food (mostly the pork belly & skin) and I wasn't very impressed with it. The space is also huge, but gives off a weird vibe because of the $15/all you can drink beer. Saw a lot of drunk people wandering around mixed with a few dates and white collar business-man.
13562	71	1.0	1	2015-01-03	Amazing food! Great location, great place.  Horrible service! After having an incredible meal, our waitress asked if we would like dessert to which we said maybe, just need another minute.  The host, Ben, then proceeded to bring the check to our table immediately and tell us that they need to use the table for someone else.  After spending over $200 for the meal and then being asked to leave by the host so they could sit someone else was unbelievable and unacceptable.  The food was so fantastic and I would almost consider not going back because of the host, Ben.  A place like this should be ashamed to have such poor service
13563	71	4.0	1	2015-01-03	I love Filipino and there just aren't a lot of Filipino restaurants in the US.  I was so excited on a recent trip to New York when my friend said we were going for Filipino food.  However, don't go expecting Filipino food, as this is really Filipino fusion or Filipino inspired.  It has a lot of the great flavors but is not the traditional.  The service was really good throughout our visit here.  My friend, my husband and I got here relatively early one night and it wasn't crowded.  We sat in the little courtyard, which was so nice and cute, the weather was great so that helped.  We sat here for awhile first enjoying drinks and then several courses.  They never rushed us as it got more crowded and its a small place, which I really appreciate. We started with chicharron, which I hadn't had since my trip to Manila and it was as delicious as I remember, crispy, sally, flavorful.  The perfect compliment to a good beer.  They had some good selections and some different beers.  I of course had to get a San Miguel, its not the best beer in the world, but reminds me of sitting on the beaches of Boracay as its the beer that is everywhere in the Philippines.  They also have an all you can drink keg which is a good idea, but none of us partaked as it was knew it would be a long night with several more stops.  My friend had some cocktails that she raved about us well. Now onto the food.  We basically shared a bunch of small dishes, starting with salads.  We got the green mango salad, pork belly adobo, and pork jowl.  They were all really good and actually all complimented each other.  I was least excited about the green mango salad, however this may have been my favorite and it was nice to have something light, fresh, and sweet to balance out the other dishes.  I simply love adobo and generally love pork belly, so this was a match made in heaven.  The pork belly is soft, meaty, and luxurious.  The adobo was as it should be complex with punches of soy and vinegar.  It balances great with the fatty pork belly.  Finally the pork jowl.  It was tender and full of pork flavor.  I am not a  huge fan of brussel sprouts but this and the fish sauce brightened it up and lifted what could have been a heavy dish.  We thought about ordering another dish, but this left us full and satisfied.
13564	71	3.0	1	2015-01-02	I live blocks away and this is the first time I checked out this place, after being Clinton streets cluster of amazing restaurants. Pros: The food was really good, especially the noodle dishes and grilled sirloin. Cons: The service! It's pretty bad. Rude and felt like we were an inconvenience to them. Oh, and the cocktails.. was there any rum in my drink?? Both cocktails tasted so watered down! Not worth the money. Stick with beer or wine.
11146	71	4.0	1	2014-12-31	I've only had Pig and Khao at Madison Square Eats, but their Thai wings are amazing. Crispy and saucy. I was a jerk and ate them on the subway, and actually got compliments on the smell vs. being yelled at and spat on. Helps that by the end of the day, they cut the price for wings in half and was offering banh mi's at a discount. The staff they had manning the booth was also hilarious. Hope to stop by the physical location soon!
13565	71	4.0	1	2014-12-29	Pros: - brussels sprouts (crispy yet soft and wonderfully seasoned) - corned beef hash (simple and delicious) - pork jowl (so tender) - doughnuts w/ pandan cream (I really liked the cream) - family style serving Cons: - sisig and hash come served on a little sizzling platter that you're supposed to mix, but the edges are so low that the food just flies everywhere - none, but I wasn't blown out of the water by the food Bottom line: interesting take on Filipino/Thai food. I highly recommend the Brussels sprouts! I went in with ridiculously high expectations, which were only partially met, but I'll probably come back for dinner.
13566	71	5.0	1	2014-12-28	Pleasantly surprised.  We visit NYC several times a year and try to find a new place each time we come.  There were 5 of us, and after ordering some drinks we decided to share 8 of the small plates. Highlights for me- pork belly- perfectly crisp and fatty, the sizzling sissig: f-in delicious.  savory, meaty, umamish.. you gotta love the different parts of perfectly cooked and seasoned pig head parts.  pork jowl- perfectly complimented by the crispy brussell sprouts.  The mango salad was tangy and fresh.  I was looking forward to trying their Khao Soi, something that I discovered while in Thailand.  Their version was good, but a little too spicy and not coconut-ish for me.  The other dishes we tried were good, but not as good as the previously mentioned.  Oh, we ordered a 2nd round of our favorites. The coconut rice is the perfect complement to the tasty/spicey/rich flavors of the other dishes.  Although we were stuffed, I had to try the Halo-Halo.  I've never had it before and didn't know what to expect.  It's essentially a hodge podge of ice cream, desserts and shaved ice.  Pretty darn delicious to me and a nice way to end a savory meal. Service was good.  Friendly and efficient. Setting- it was warm inside and probably could have benefited by keeping a door propped open.  But, I guess it lent to feeling like we were eating in SE Asia. I'd definitely eat here again.  Our friends who are locals added it to their list of regular spots.
13567	71	4.0	1	2014-12-27	From decorations to the style of food, this place is unique. What makes it more unique is that it makes all these with such normal raw material of porks. We tried a standard n-course menu. Every dish is so great that we are very full for the last dish. Coconut water is worth a try as well.
13568	71	5.0	1	2014-12-23	"There's plenty of reasons for me to give this 5 stars.... Of course we can talk about the food which is slamming...enough for my bf who's a chef to approve as well.  And to hear the words ""I'll definitely come back here"" was a surprising shock, since all the places we've been to that's fairly new he likes to call them all disasters and tell me that my choosing privileges have been revoked for one month. There's also the bottomless backyard beer, and fair to say that the employers did NOT kick us out after staying there for over 3 hours.  No jeans today...only loose dresses and tights. If you're planning on wearing jeans make sure you loosen the zipper and let it all hang out. The cute little bathroom, I'm sure some of you might walk pass it not knowing it was the bathroom.  Just wait till you see someone wait on line for it and then make your move.  Although they should really flip that tp holder the other way, I dropped the tp and it rolled all over the floor =x But my biggest reason for giving them 5 stars is because my bf and I were sitting next to these awful, pretentious, CHEAP, business men who prob think they make more than us service industry peeps.  They ordered the tasting which was $45. And for all common sense people this means $45 PER PERSON.  While their cheap asses were chugging down PBRs like they were 17 buying illegal beer, their whole conversation went ""WAIT...is that $45 per person? or $45 total (for three people)."" ""No dude, it's $45 total."" And for about a good 1.5 hours I spent my time tortured by their conversation when they could've just grown some balls, 2 balls out of 6, to ask their server.  Instead, when the bill came, they decided to flip on this poor waitress, who's name is Fay (which I remembered bc that's my bf's mom's name same spelling) and she's totally awesome by the way. And she calmly explained to them and they kept flipping where the manager had to come over.  And of course these jerks got their way, laughing on their way out...leaving a $5 tip.  Nothing makes me more upset than seeing this happen, and so 5 stars to you peeps who work there.  You don't need their business, you definitely will always have mine!  -=preach=-"
13569	71	5.0	1	2014-12-21	Awesome food. Love pork jowl, Khao Soi and Grilled Octopus. It is our third visit. We are yet to be disappointed with anything
13570	71	5.0	1	2014-12-18	The food is awesome! My suggestion is ordering two small plates and one appetizer or alternatively, an appetizer and a main dish for two person. We ordered two small plates and a main dish for two and it was too much! Shan noodles is amazingly flavorful. We also had the bbq pork ribs which is pretty good, as well, better when paired with coconut rice. Remember to wash it down with a bottle of San Mig!
11587	71	4.0	1	2014-12-18	Went there because one of the friends I had dinner with works with a company that does business with pig and khao so we thought why not? We basically had everything that the server recommended. It is a very interesting fusion. It has very tasty mix of cuisine. Worth a try. Not sure I will return but I would definitely recommend it to friends and family.
13571	71	5.0	1	2014-12-17	Pig and Khao specializes in South East Asian cuisine, presumably leaning a bit more on Filipino cuisine. The restaurant is located at the Lower East side and it has a hipster ambiance. The kitchen is right in the middle of the restaurant that invokes openness and transparency (A definite plus for those who love to see their food being made!) The dinner menu was well laid out which made ordering effortless. The waiter was also nearby and ready to explain and answer our queries. We started our dinner with Pegroni and Perfect Storm cocktails. We opted for the small plates on the menu and had the Sizzling Sisig; minced pork head with chili and raw egg. Khao Soi; a red curry and coconut milk based with rice and crispy noodles. Grilled Sirloin with an Isan sauce and Coconut rice. We concluded the dinner with Turon; banana fritter with salted caramel ice cream and chocolate sauce. Although It was not a fine dining experience (dictionary.cambridge.org…) the quality of food and customer service blew us away. It was one perfect date night everyone should have.
13572	71	3.0	1	2014-12-13	I heard great things about this place. This place would have been a 4 but the coconut rice is way too sweet. I am Vietnamese & I can eat fresh chillies; but, the Khao Soi was way too spicy. The server had the audacity to tell me that it is meant to be that spicy. I had to chow down two glasses of water! Quality control, man!
13573	71	5.0	1	2014-12-13	I swear, this was one of the best meals I've had out in the city in a long time. The interior is nicely lit, bustling, and aromatic in a way that takes you out of Manhattan for the duration of your meal. All the Filipino, family-style dishes - think Spanish with South-East Asian influences - were generous and flavorful. Our meal began with crispy chicharron with a vinegar based sauce, then followed by a feast to remember: crispy pork with ginger sauce, an octopus salad, grilled brussel sprouts with pork, and sisig (yep, more pork) with an egg literally frying as the plate was brought out. The pork was decadent, the breading perfectly crisped, and the salad dressing a perfect, lime-infused complement to the firm octopus. Oh, and the coconut rice! It was fluffy with not too much coconut flavor - jaw-droppingly good. I cannot wait to take more of my friends here.
12388	71	4.0	1	2014-12-09	so cheap, very full, order a ton, chicken wings, noodles, fried rice/meat.
13574	71	5.0	1	2014-12-08	Few spots make me gush but this is one of them. Highlights: Grilled Pork Jowl. I don't quite understand how brussel sprouts can taste this good but this dish was my absolute favorite. Chicken wings. Chicken wings don't usually excite me that much but these wings are so very delicious. The sauce is AMAZING. Pork Belly. Yes, I have a pork belly obsession in general but this one comes with the added bonus of a great sauce. Coconut Rice. Wow. Almost dessert-like perfection.
13575	71	4.0	1	2014-12-08	I love this place. I've Only been there for dinner never brunch but it never disappoints.better to make reservations if it's more than 2 of y'all. They allow walk-ins but will always offer the kitchen bar 1st...which is cool if u wanna watch them make your dish but it can get hot near the flames. My go-to is the khao Soi or Sizzling Sisig with coconut rice.The rice is really good and goes with everything. The portions are generous on both dishes.The mango salad is really good as well...tried the mussels they were nothing special. The drinks are meh! so go there to eat not get drunk. although  $15 bottomless cups of beer can be a good night starter if your looking to do damage. The vibe is upbeat and it feels young and hip.The playlist is always decent with something for everybody.A little heavy on the hip hop side but they do a good job of mixing it up. Will be back soon.
13576	71	3.0	1	2014-12-08	I came here to do a  school project on international cuisine. This was the first time I tried Filipino food so I was super exited! My boyfriend and I walked in about 30 min earlier than our reservation hoping they would seat us and they did! We decided to go and sit at the bar and we can watch the chefs cook up our food! That was a mistake! I saw the chefs using their bare hands to grab shrimp chips in the serving bowls, when there was a spoon for it, I saw the chef picking at a customers plate that was set to go out in the dining room! (Used bare finger to grab a piece from customers plate and put it in mouth) Another chef is making stuff on the stove and uses the same spoon for cooking every dish as well as tasting too! No where did I ever see them washing or changing the spoon! The only reason I gave this please 3 and not 2 stars was because of the food. I actually got the chefs tasting menu. (Bad decision) I n the end I spent about 110 for 2 people, which I didn't feel like it was worth it! I felt like ordering off the regular menu would have been so much more worth it! Some dishes in the chefs menu come smaller than the dishes that go out as a regular order! And mind you we have to share the dishes between two people! I honestly felt tricked by the chefs tasting menu! It's a no go!!! We started one bite spring roll. It was meh, I've made better! Next we got pork jowl and Brussels sprout dish, it was good but too salty and I noticed our plate was more burnt than the other plates coming out! We couldn't finish it even with the coconut rice! The coconut rice is a MUST GET! Tastes like the inside of a coconut! (Chefs tasting menu only included 1 rice for us to share) Next we got the wings. (This was when I noticed that the potion sizes were different, we only got 4 wings and the chef gave out 8 wings to the regular plates) They honestly were finger licking good and paired well with the rice! After that we got some curry noodle soup with crunchy noodles on that. It was not all that, ontop of that it was super salty, we didn't even try to finish that!!! For our entree we got the sizzling sisig, this was the dish I really wanted to try! (From all the yelp reviews and photos)  It was super fatty, but tasted good, this was when I realized that they should've gave the rice for us here, this dish here again was super salty! For dessert we got the chose from ricotta donuts, banana fritters, and halo halo.  My boyfriend really wanted the banana fritter and I wanted the halo halo, the chef said they would bring me up a small halo halo, I was super thankful for that! The banana fritters were mehhhh, could care less! The halo halo on the other hand was BOMB.com!!!! Loved the flan in there as well as the ube ice cream! I hear there are way better Filipino restaurants around, I will soon be trying them! Pig and khao did no make me want to come back a second time!
13577	71	4.0	1	2014-12-07	I like this place a lot.  The fusion of Thai and Filipino just makes it unique enough to stand out, but the actual execution of the dishes is what makes it a winner. I've been here twice now and have been very happy both times. Some of the highlights: - The pork belly adobo was great. Sauce was spot on and the thin slices of pork belly cooked perfectly. - Their sisig is one of the best I've ever had (and that includes my trips to the Philippines). - Khao Soi with coconut rice is the only way to go, delicious together. - The Crispy Pata was great! - Save room for dessert, the Halo Halo is some of the best I've ever had as well! I'd say the only disappointments was the grilled sirloin (they were good, but nothing really special) and the baby back ribs (did it really like the sauce).
13578	71	5.0	1	2014-12-06	This place is awesome. They serve up some unique foods with great asian/tropical flavors. Their pork dishes are great. Don't leave without having the Halo halo. You'll never have anything else like it. Shaved ice, coconut, flan, crisped rice, purple yam ice cream, and a type of plantain. Do it.
13579	71	5.0	1	2014-12-06	Before I start my review, I have to confess that I was a little tipsy when I was eating, so I rated the place in a super happy mood LOL. Food:  Amazing.  Every dish was executed well.  We ordered 3 large plates, 3 small plates and 3 desert to share between 8 people.   Grill Pork Jawl Shan Noodle Sizzling Sisig Crispy Pata Baby Back Ribs fish Turon Halo-Halo Another fried dough dish as desert.   I also ordered the drink: Sweet  and sour cilantro  with Gin. Overall, happy with everything we ordered.  Our bill came out to be $40 with the drink. Service: All of the servers were super nice.  They recommenced the drink and food, comped the drink we had while we were waiting for our table. Already craving for their food, definitely will be returning to this place.  hopefully sooner than later.
13580	71	4.0	1	2014-12-06	Co-owner and chef Leah Cohen who was also a contestant on Top Chef has brought the bright and vibrant flavors of Southeast Asia to the Lower East Side. Her Filipino and Pork Belly Adobo. You can wash it all down with a can of beer, opt for the bottomless tap in the backyard, or go with the fresh young coconut chopped open with rum added for that tropical kick in the teeth!
13581	71	4.0	1	2014-12-05	Walked in and I loved the atmosphere. Yellow lighting and nineties hip-hop - only the best genre of music. Staff - including the hostess - was very friendly. Only a twenty five minute wait on a Friday night. Food was good but not spectacular. We ordered the Khao Soi, Grilled Sirloin, and Crispy Pata. Portions were modest. Khao Soi had a great coconut sauce and the chicken was perfect. Mantou Buns are like the Chinese donuts you eat at buffets. Coconut rice was great but not the best in the city (Jeepney makes it better). The main entrees were good, but not the best, for Filipino food in the city. However, the dessert is the best in the city. The Ricotta Donuts (highliy recommend - the dipping sauce is amazing) and Halo-Halo exceeded any other filipino restaurant desserts in the city. Overall, service and ambiance were perfect - the hostess was friendly as I inquired how long waits were. The entrees were good - but not the best - in the city. However, the dessert makes up for that.
13582	71	4.0	1	2014-12-05	My favorite Filipino spot! I've been here three times? I'd come more often if it wasn't such a fat fest that I always feel bad about after. My workout for the impending meal starts before I even order -- stomach clenching as soon as I'm given a menu and glance over all of the artery clogging goodness. My go to at each Filipino spot that I've been to(and probably yours) -- sizzling sisig. Incredible! Pig and Khao makes my absolute favorite. Topped with a raw egg, it's fattier and saltier than anywhere else, and also seasoned better. Along with a side of incredibly fragrant and sweet coconut rice(so good that I can eat standalone) I could finish the whole plate of chewy, cartilage-y pork bits on my own but somehow have the self-control not to. Alas, more is coming! I usually also spit the khao soi -- this dish is equally incredible. The curry is creamy with a mild heat and has a very distinct coconut presence. The egg noodles are wonderfully chewy. The bowl is topped off with a generous amount of crispy noodles. Any leftover coconut rice is soaked in the curry and always finished, mmm. I've also tried the baby back ribs(saucy, meaty and extremely tender) and octopus salad(nothing special and kind of expensive for what it was) but have gone back to my two go-tos. Louis CK puts it best -- The meal is not over when I'm full. The meal is over when I hate myself. So of course, the meal must be topped off with the halo halo. I selfishly devour most of the incredible flan and ube ice cream before spooning as much pinipig as I can onto each bite of shaved ice. And now, I hate myself. Worth it.
13583	71	5.0	1	2014-12-03	sizziling pig head different but tasty.  The cod in banana leaf is outstanding.  And as always the khao soi rocks!
13584	71	3.0	1	2014-11-21	A table for two. Came here for dinner on a week night. Wasn't crowded. Service was quick. Our glasses were always refilled with water. Atmosphere inside was dimly lit. Decor was ok. We ordered.... Dinuguan pork stew. A bowl of chopped up pork shoulder meat with banana chilies and crunchy things. Not sure what the crunchy things are. It kind of taste like bone or cartilage.  It comes with steamed rice cakes which goes very well with the stew sauce. It's not that much broth in the stew. The seasoning and spice is unique and yummy. Sizzling sisig was a bit salty for my taste but my other half likes it. It taste much better with squeezed lime on it. Coconut rice is delicious! Feeds two people. Really tastes like coconut. Halo halo for dessert. Consists of flan, cornflakes, coconut flakes, shaved ice, condensed milk (?), and purple yam ice cream. Purple yam ice cream tastes like taro. Very good! Overall meal was filling. Food was good but nothing amazingly great that would make us go back a second time. Service, atmosphere, decor was good.
13585	71	5.0	1	2014-11-20	"My in-laws' last-minute Sunday brunch request meant I was desperately calling every bookmarked restaurant on the Lower East Side. One of the first restaurants I thought of was Pig & Khao. After trying P&K at Madison Square Eats, I had been hoping to get out to the actual brick & mortar location for a while. The man who answered the phone said that yes, they did have a table ... but apologetically said it was outside on their ""heated patio."" Now, it was a brisk 30F that day, and I was skeptical. Ultimately, they were the only restaurant with room for four (plus a high chair for my niece), so we decided to check out this patio. And? ... what a misleading!! The ""patio"" was enclosed, and the heat lamps were large & mounted on the walls. Our table was totally comfortable and I wouldn't have even known it was outside! It was super comfortable, and I was beyond excited to finally try a restaurant I've had my eyes on for months. Filipino brunch is best-served family style, so that's exactly what we did! Our party of 4 ordered the following: Sizzling Sisig Sizzling Corned Beef Hash Longanissa Sausage Grilled Pork Jowl Side of Longanissa Sausage Garlic Rice A glass of Riesling Unlimited Orange Mimosas (of course!) My FAVORITE dish was the Sisig. I had been dying to try sisig, and this dish did not disappoint! Yes, I know it's sketch because it's made of ""assorted pig parts,"" but seriously, it's so good. A little crunchy, a little soft, a little fatty, all mixed in with an egg & a touch of some sweet carmelization action. When you eat it with a little garlic rice? Ahhhhh, pure heaven. Some of the best pork I've ever had. Seriously, so good. I would order this every single time. You have to try it!! The Pork Jowl was an unexpected hit. My sister-in-law wanted to order it, and the rest of us were skeptical. And the jowl -- often called the best piece of meat -- was good, but the accompanying Brussels Sprouts were AMAZING! Sorry to say that the jowl took a backseat to the garnish, but seriously. Perfectly cooked & so delicious. The other dishes weren't really veggie-friendly, so I would totally suggest that you order this for brunch. (Not that you needed another reason, but I'm saying!) The Corned Beef was similar to the Sisig, but with a bit more of a kick to it. I wasn't expecting that much spice! It was still pretty good, but it didn't compare to the Sisig. The Longanissa was also good -- my fiance & my niece were big fans. Longanissa is sweet, and a little rich, so the main dish serving isn't as large as you would expect. But you don't want to eat a lot of it ... so I wouldn't recommend ordering it unless you're willing to share! And what Filipino meal is complete without Garlic Rice? Not a one, I tell you. Unlimited mimosas are worth it, if you're having more than one. I like that there are multiple flavors ... but my sister-in-law & I stuck with orange. Sometimes, you just don't mess with the classics. Our server was really cool & friendly. He kept those mimosas from getting too bottomless, and even though we were warned that the dishes come out when they're ready, everything came out really quickly. Everything was perfect. The food was outstanding, the accommodations were awesome, & we were so, so happy that we made last minute brunch plans at Pig & Khao. One of the best brunches I've ever had in the city. Just so different from the regular fare, you know? If you haven't had Filipino food before, this is a great place to start. And if you have? Well, let's just say I hope you're reading this from the table on that comfy back patio."
13586	71	2.0	1	2014-11-18	Wow. What a disappointing, inconsistent place. I really thought we had found a new neighborhood spot that wasn't overrated, overpriced, and overrun with hipsters, but apparently that hope was as worthless as when I thought music could make a comeback after the shitestorm of knives in my ears that happened in the early 2000s. Tonight was our second time at Pig and Khao and it just didn't cut it for the price or the cuisine. The dish we went crazy over the first time (the green mango chicken salad) had zero spice to it which, for me, defeats the purpose of going to a Southeast Asian restaurant. And the pork belly with pumpkin puree special was just bad. Too sweet, not spicy, and poorly selected cuts.   My guy, who is ordinarily unforgiving of these types of flaws in certain cuisines, was not nearly as turned off as I and was willing to give another dish a chance, but before we had an opportunity to do so the smell of cleaning products poured over the restaurant. At first I thought that maybe the kitchen realized they were kind of blowing it tonight and attempted to spare all of us from tasting any more of what they were serving up, but the truth is that the bar, which is right at the front of the restaurant and in close proximity to plenty of tables, decided to wipe down every bottle of liquor with windex. In the middle of service. And when it was brought to his attention a big grin came across his face and he continued! I'm always surprised to see that kind of attitude from a position that doesn't rely on a salary, but tips from the people that you're disturbing. Maybe he hasn't been working in restaurants long enough to know that vodka should be used to clean down his bar, but, for me, attitude and inconsistent food are two strikes too big to keep me coming back.
13587	71	2.0	1	2014-11-18	Just ate here again moments ago and it was a solid disappointment. The food's okay, but I've never been in a restaurant that happily uses windex in the middle of service while people are eating. The bartender decided to start closing up and was wiping down the bottles using windex. It was a real oddity. Every other restaurant in the free world has figured out that it's about the most awful smell you'd want to inflict on your customers and uses vodka instead. I can't think of a cuisine that would benefit from this odor encompassing the dining area. Since I've never been in a place that doesn't use vodka (convenient, scentless) instead, I've also never been in a place where you tell someone about the scent being off-putting and ruining your meal and they just keep using it anyway. They didn't stop! They just kept using the windex! And laughed out loud about it! We ended up leaving pretty abruptly. It puts me in the unfortunate position of writing another place off based on ignorance and lack of appropriate response. Like I said, the food's still okay, but this is what you can get in this place so now you know. Amateurs.
13588	71	3.0	1	2014-11-17	"3 stars on Yelp but 3.5 stars in reality. Look, this place is ok. If you have a date and you want to take him or her to a nice Asian ""fusion"" spot that makes you look like you're in the know, then by all means. My only comment is that this place is overpriced for what they offer and following this dining experience I've given up on Filipino food. ...Not that I'll never eat it again or try it again, but I'll never go to a Filipino restaurant thinking: ""OH MAN. IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS FOOD."" That's happened more than a few times in recent memory and every time I'm left incredibly disappointed. Filipino food is greasy. Like we're talking 'yo-why-the-hell-would-you-make-this-kind-of-food' kind of crazy. It's also insanely bland at times. Which blows my mind because for the longest time the Philippines served as the Nexus for trading ports in Asia, and there were traders and merchants from all over the world gathered in the Philippines. But somehow we end up with greasy as hell food and no other condiment but ketchup. Maharlika is the only Filipino restaurant that I'm completely sold on. Jeepney is godawful and Pig and Khao is just passable. We shared: Grilled Pork Jowl Khao Soi Crispy Pata or Ribs...I'm drawing a blank on the large plate dish cuz it's been so long. Nevertheless, the dishes were good enough. They were very filling, but made me wonder if the prices they were being offered at were worth it. The Jowl was good. But it was a few pieces of meat for $13. The Khao Soi was reasonably priced. But the last large plate was not. I imagine this place would be a better fit for larger groups, as you can sample more dishes while splitting the cost down further. When all is said and done it's an 'A-OK' in my book."
13589	71	4.0	1	2014-11-14	"Oink oink oink piggy piggy piggy I always get the same thing every time I go to a Filipino restaurant: Longinizza with a side of garlic rice, and a salad, so I can neglect and complain about how much I hate salads. If I was a rabbit, I still wouldn't eat a salad; I'd be a cute rabbit though, one of those bacon eating bunnies that smell good all the time. Anywho, yeah... the first time I've been to a Filipino restaurant... WITH NO LONGINIZZA, dun dun duuuuuuuuuuun (and garlic rice). It didn't really ruin my night because I was feeling adventurous, so I opted for the Sizzling Sisig. Nothing quite says adventure like a mutilated pig head does. At first I didn't want to go for it because the Adobo sounded amazing with it's garlic flavors, and my Filipino friend whom I went with recommended the Sisig, and I was in the mood to spite him for fun. You know, gotta assert your dominance sometimes *gorilla noises*, but it sounded too good to pass up. My friend ordered something else, I don't care, my food tasted too good to pay attention to his dish. So, that's how I felt about that *thumbs up*. The bowl of coconut rice comes in a decent size, which is beautiful because I was in no mood to spend extra money, so my friend had enough of his rice to share hehehe. There's a smoothness to the sweetness in the coconut rice, the kind of smooth I'd expect from the lips of that anorexic girl I have a crush on (must find a way to get her boyfriend out of the picture). The last thing I want to talk about was the first thing that caught my eye: ""Add any whiskey to your tea"". Yeah, two of my favorite things in the world combined, something I imagine a refined caveman would enjoy drinking. I got the Ginger Darjeeling with their only choice of whiskey (I forgot); it comes in a small pot, so you don't have to worry about getting a tiny cup, and when I got it, there was a sweet musk to it. One of the better smelling liquids I've ever smelt, if you ask me. The delight ends there though, it tasted like complete ass. Complete $7 down the toilet ass. Don't get it. Make it and feed it to your children when they're misbehaving but for the love of tea and whiskey, don't pay for it."
13590	71	4.0	1	2014-11-13	"This place is dishing out big flavors and unique dishes. As you can imagine, they are serious about their pork -- there are definitely things on the menu I have never seen before, and also familiar things done in new ways (i.e. pork belly). I highly recommend going with an open mind and try something new, because life is too short to stick with the same old bacon and pork chops. Grilled Pork Jowl: a seriously unconventional salad. It was not love at first bite -- there's a strong hit of acid that is overwhelming. However, I just couldn't stop eating bite after bite. My first time eating pork jowl, and it was tender with crispy caramelized bits. Mixed with some bitterness from brussels sprouts, a little heat/spiciness, and an enticing combo of sweet and savory. What a flavor bomb in your mouth. I never thought I would say that I found pork jowl addicting. Pork Belly (special): the special that night was pork belly atop squash puree with bok choy. I'm not sure if the pork belly is cooked the same way as the adobo on the regular menu, but this was amazingly delicious. There's some serious umami going on from the asian sauces, and it's sliced thin so again there's the caramelized crispy bits. I'm not sure what the connection was to the squash, but it was delicious nonetheless and we almost licked the plate clean. Portion was a bit small. Still worth it. Sizzling Sisig: just say it a few times -- too fun. Per the menu description, it's pork head -- definitely NOT typical, but I actually found it disappointingly... normal. The meat is very tender, chopped up small, and served on a sizzling hot plate with a cracked egg on top. It was a little too salty, and I was looking for some sweetness or sourness to add depth, like the ones we found in the other dishes. But since it's apparently the dish they are known for, I'm glad I tried it. It was still super tasty. Khao Soi: not a bad dish, but definitely the most ordinary that we ordered. This is like the typical red curry with noodles that you can find at most Thai restaurants. I'd skip it. Coconut Rice: Yes, you are wondering why I am including rice in my review. But this is no ordinary ""side of rice."" It's a sticky, flavorful, amazing fluffy dome of rice. Slightly sweet and fragrant with coconut, it pairs so well with the saltiness/sourness of the other plates. This might've been my favorite thing we ordered. Again, so addictive. 1 order serves 2-3 people. Or hey you can down the whole bowl yourself - it's that good. Our waitress was awesome, super friendly and helpful. Ambience is casual and low-key. There are some fun cocktails on the menu. Overall, I really appreciate what they're doing here and will definitely be going back. Like I said, this food is seriously addictive."
13591	71	4.0	1	2014-11-12	Went there for dinner during the week. Food was awesome. The GRILLED SIRLOIN was amazing, as well as, a few of the sides. The self serve bottomless draft was perfect, such a great idea. Service was nice and the evening I was there they played hiphop all night. Was just a great experience for dinner.
13592	71	4.0	1	2014-11-11	I've been back here a few times and I have say that I really like it. The service leaves a bit to be desired, but the food has been great. P&K has become one of my favorite neighborhood spots.
13593	71	2.0	1	2014-11-09	Went there for brunch on Sunday. I had BAHN XEO and my friend had LONGONISSA SAUSAGE. Really flat flavors + crappy presentation + small portions. Ambiance is OK inside, but we were in the garden area which was lacking even that. The reason for us staying in the garden was the fact that the ventilation indoors is very poor and we really didn't want to reek of kitchen smells. With a huge variety of great food on L.E.S. there is no chance I'd try to go back to that place again.
13594	71	3.0	1	2014-11-03	This was so-so filipino food. I don't know what the hype is about, seems like a handful of yelpers write a review, others go and write more reviews, and it's a nice example of a snowball effect. MEHHH.
13595	71	4.0	1	2014-11-02	A pleasant surprise for me. I really enjoyed the pork belly adobo (two orders worth), coconut rice, and halo halo. I liked both noodle dishes as well but I wish the khao soi noodles were soft noodles versus crunchy.
13596	71	4.0	1	2014-10-24	We were on a quest for authentic Khao Soi, a Northern Thai yellow curry egg noodle w chicken... We didn't exactly find street-food worthy Khao Soi, but it was delicious nevertheless. I wish the dish had less of the fried noodles on top and more of the slurpy egg noodles below. It's what I call chic-Thai food (dressed up in a pretty package of restaurant ambiance and served with cute hipster waiters). We also ordered the grilled pork Jowl - excellent! Smoky & fatty slices of meat over charred brussels with salty fish sauce. the Cod in a Banana Leaf was amazing. Dense creamy coconut flavor envelopes an otherwise plain white fish. Sweet & tropical! All was washed down with several Tiger lager beers.
13597	71	4.0	1	2014-10-23	"Forget all the hater reviews you see below. Who actually complains food has too much flavor? If you like bland food stay home and make room for people who appreciate amazing food. I love love love the khao soi at this place. This is the only place I've ever had it and it makes me sad that not many Thai establishments offer this dish. It's a spicy coconut curry with fried and boiled egg noodles with chicken. I could eat this everyday forever and be happy. NO lie. You also can't go wrong with their sizzling sisig. As a Filipina I know my sisig and I know my pork. Don't be turned off by the description of ""pork head."" It's a different texture but still tastes like 'normal' pork. I heard this place also has bottomless mimosas for $15. I've been here twice for dinner.. I have to come back for some drunch."
13598	71	5.0	1	2014-10-23	"Walked in without a reservation on a Monday night. Sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen and enjoyed one of the most interesting and unpretentious adventures I've had in a NYC restaurant. The menu is exciting, but doesn't adequately describe the food -- beautiful but not prissy, spicy, fragrant, fresh and somehow familiar and new at the same time. My daughter and I shared four dishes and each was its own distinct experience. Portions are fair for the price, and generous for ""small plates."" Only the pork jowls were a let-down -- not a hint of crisp -- but the accompanying caramelized lime-chili brussels sprouts (we were told a seasonal substitute for watermelon) more than compensated. Staff are professional and completely at ease. From start to finish, Pig and Khao is confident, and it should be. This place is a find."
13599	71	4.0	1	2014-10-22	I made reservations on opentable because I had heard it gets really packed.  We went around 6:30 and it was pretty empty but it filled up pretty quickly around 7. We ordered the khao soi, mango chicken salad, sizzling sisig, pork belly adobo and the halo halo. We also ordered some drinks but didn't really care for those. I love pork belly and poached egg so I was a fan of this.  I was hesitant to try the sizzling sisig because it's pork ears but because of the reviews we decided we had to try it.  The mango chicken salad and refreshing and it balanced out the heaviness of everything else and the khao soi was really good. It had a strong coconut and curry taste but I loved it.  The halo halo was so good esp the ube ice cream and the condensed milk.  We left feeling so full. All in all great meal.
13600	71	5.0	1	2014-10-09	All I can say is you had me at pork belly adobo! The mussels in lemongrass broth were another favorite. Everyone at my table chose something different, so we all tried each other's dishes. Don't forget to order the coconut rice! Everything was delightfully seasoned and prepared! An adventurous foodie heaven!
13601	71	3.0	1	2014-10-08	"My friends and I came a while ago for my birthday, and overall the experience was ok.  We were a group of 4 and ordered a few items to share.   The Shan Noodles, the Sisig, and an order of veggies that reminded me of Chinese Broccoli.  The Shan Noodles were good.  The Sisig was a lot spicier than I had expected, even though I had asked the waitress to tell me how spicy it was going to be before ordering it.  She said it was mildly spicy, but for a person who does not have much of a spice tolerance, I was feverishly eating rice to cool down my mouth.  It was very good, but probably even better for someone who likes spice.  The side of veggies was ok, standard asian style veggies. The ambiance was interesting, the music was very ""lower east side"", if there even is such a time now with all the changes that has been happening in the neighborhood.  On the louder side, so be prepare to raise your voice a little. If you like spicy food, stop by, otherwise if you are like me, I would skip it."
13602	71	2.0	1	2014-10-08	I wanted to like this place.  The two stars are really for the service, not for the food.  We ordered the sisig, khai soi, and halo halo.  The sisig was way too salty and didn't have the crunchy bits that I look for in any good sisig.  The khai soi was decent, curry was spicy and i liked the crispy egg noodles on top.  The halo halo was not that great, didn't have a lot of ingredients like other places.  It only had the ube ice cream, milk, ice, crispy rice, 2 bites of plaintains and 2 bites of leche flan.  There was mostly ice and didn't have the other stuff that I dig for like palm fruit, jelly, etc.  It definitely was not worth $8.  All the dishes were pretty small portioned and overpriced.  There are better Filipino/Thai places that are reasonably priced and larger portions.  I will not be back.
13603	71	5.0	1	2014-10-01	Amazing food! You walk in thinking this place might be over rated from just the appearance alone, but once the food comes...oh.my.god... You will not be dissapointed. The dishes are small, except for the noodles, they are very large.
13604	71	3.0	1	2014-09-29	Yeah, you have to love pork and you have to love it a lot.  We ordered the pig face, pig leg, and pork belly.  Very flavorful but very greasy.  Eat at your own risk.  The coconut rice is awesome and you only need one bowl to share between 2 people ( we obviously learned it the hard way).
13605	71	4.0	1	2014-09-29	Our friends recently introduced us to this LES spot, and we will definitely be coming here again soon. Owned by a former Top Chef contestant, I would say this place offers Southeast Asian food with strong Thai and Filipino influences. Sorry folks, no Balut. The menu is small, but you will still have trouble choosing. In that case, you are in luck. The small plates are perfect for sharing and reasonably priced, so I suggest ordering a variety of things. The night we were there, they offered a tasting menu...not sure if they is an every day occurrence. Recommendations: Sizzling Sisig Shan Noodles Pork Belly Adobo Pork Jowl - good, but definitely ranks 4th on this list. Turon for dessert - a must The Mantao Buns were a nice surprise too They offer a San Miguel (as they should), but how do you say no to Genny Cream Ale? Great service. Everyone is amazingly friendly, and I never had an empty beer. Cool little spot with a great soundtrack.
13606	71	5.0	1	2014-09-28	Delicious and fun brunch!!! Gorgeous place, great service, and no crowd.  The bottomless mimosas in several flavors were awesome, and the server kept them coming. We split a couple items at the table (about one per person) along with some rice and that was ideal. The food is slightly adventurous for some but not inaccessible to any. Everything was pretty delicious, although we did not care for pork head (even if you get over what you're eating, it's really vey fatty). Be a little careful that you aren't ordering a bunch of similar items because a lot of them are heavy on meat and it can be kind of a lot. I will definitely come back to try dinner next time I'm in town!
13607	71	2.0	1	2014-09-25	It's interesting how people think this is an authentic Filipino food.  Somebody told me about this trendy spot, and I decided to check it out.  Honestly the food is ok, but I prefer the homemade version at Tito Rad's than this restaurant that caters tourists and pretentious hipsters.  Oh and Filipinos don't use chopsticks.
13608	71	4.0	1	2014-09-25	In love! Dinner on a Thursday night. Right on time with my reservation. A friend and I chose to do the $45 per person chef's menu. Didn't disappoint. You must love pork to love this menu. Favorites were fried oysters and the tongue and cheek with an egg, so good! Very full by they last dish of egg noodles with curry. Highly recommend. Cool spot, great food, great staff.
13609	71	4.0	1	2014-09-21	After deciding not to wait over an hour to eat at Barrio Chino on a Friday night at 8, my date and I decided to check out the Filipino fare at Pig and Khao. Neither of us had ever dined at a Filipino restaurant before, and the only item I'd ever tried was lumpia, so this was sure to be an eating adventure. For anyone who might be afraid to try Filipino food due to a lack of familiarity, I'd say that despite the geographical differences, if you've ever had SE Asian cuisine (Thai, Malaysian, etc), there area number of menu options that should seem similar enough to make you feel comfortable, while still offering a Filipino twist. The inclusion of many small plates on the menu lends itself nicely to trying a number of different items and sharing food with others, and my date and I ordered three. We also ordered a bowl of cocout rice, which was really nice for mixing. For drinks, I ordered the Stinky Peat and my date ordered the Pigroni, and both were really good. -Sizzling Sisig 8/10: The plate comes sizzling with pork and it's your job to cook the egg on top.. so it's a pretty cool presentation. There was very good flavor in the dish, and some of the pork was crunchy, while some was on the softer side. Overall, this was a tasty intro to Filipino food. I would order this dish again. -Pork Belly Adobo 6/10: This came out while we were still working on the Sisig and it was almost a little overwhelming as the tables aren't very big. The flavor was good and the pork belly was tender, but the ratio of fat to pork was a little high for me here. I would not order this dish again. -Shan Noodles 8/10: This dish came out last when we were almost already full. However, it was extremely flavorful and complemented the rest of the meal nicely. The flavor of these noodles reminded me of several SE Asian noodle dishes and it was a great way to finish the meal. I would order this dish again. Overall, this was a good dining experience. The service was reasonably good, the atmosphere was good for a date or a friendly gathering, and the food definitely made it worth coming back for another visit.
13610	71	2.0	1	2014-09-20	Can the portions be any smaller?? Went here over the summer and Thank God my friend picked up the tab because had I been the one to shell out money, I would have asked for a refund. I get it, it's tapas style higher end Filipino food. But can I get food portions that justify the price tag?
13611	71	5.0	1	2014-09-19	Food is awesome, a bit spicier than I expected with the sisig (very weak spicy palate) but still fantastic. As a snobby UES-er I wish I could eat there more. Let's open a spot up here!
13612	71	3.0	1	2014-09-15	PRO: - KHAO SOI - Pretty spicy but it was very good. I love the strong curry flavor and the crunchy toppings on the noodles. - BBQ Baby Back Ribs - very flavorful. Meat was about to fall off. It was very moist and juicy. EHH: - Cod in Banana Leaf - nothing special. It was tasted ok. - Grilled Sirloin - Very spicy and it taste eh. Mouth was on fire after eating this. I had to drink like 2 cups of water to make it go away. - Market Vegetable - Just Regular Chinese Choy Sum you can get at any chinese restaurant. - Grilled Pork Jowl - watermelon had a really nice lime/citrus/vinaigrette taste however the pork was ok. The watermelon was my favorite part. - Sizzling Sig Sig - Too salty and too much fat meat and cartilage - Ginataang Kalabasa - Did not like the sauce. Even though I liked the chinese long beans and the squash, the sauce ruined it. The sauce had this weird coconut milk taste and don't get me wrong I love coconut milk but this just didn't taste right. - Halo Halo - Overrated. It looks cool with the purple yam ice cream on the top but this dessert reminded me of sweet cereal (like fruit loops) and condensed milk. I thought this was too sweet for my liking. I am glad I had a party of 4 sharing this. I definitely couldn't have finished it myself.
13613	71	4.0	1	2014-09-12	Pork belly with poached egg was delicious, although a little bit of a small serve. The Shan Noodles were very plentiful and much better value, with an amazing broth. Definitely sit out back, and the $15 all you can drink self serve Yeunling is a steal too. Definitely would go back...
13614	71	5.0	1	2014-09-11	I haven't been to the restaurant itself, however they have a stand for Madison Square Eats in the Flatiron where I had the Vietnamese porkball bahn mi and it was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend it and I will take a trip to the restaurant next time im in lower Manhattan
13615	71	2.0	1	2014-09-09	"I live in the neighborhood but as a vegetarian I always shied away from this place for obvious reasons -- until I read the review mentioning that a lot of their dishes can be made vegetarian.  I went to check it out and got a vegetarian version of the green mango salad and the khao soi.  They replaced chicken with tofu for both, and both dishes were too die for!!!  Very flavorful and just the right amount of spice. Unfortunately, on my second visit, I was informed that the ""vegetarian"" version of the khao soi actually has shrimp paste, and that *none* of the entrees could be made vegetarian.  So I was stuck with the mango salad and a side of morning glory.  Both were delish, but that's not a meal, and I am so sad I will never get to have that khao soi.  I find it interesting that places all over Southeast Asia were able to accommodate my vegetarian restriction but not a foodie restaurant in NYC.  Especially when the chef apparently said in an interview two years ago that she planned to  ""develop a few 'full and hearty' vegetarian options.""  I won't be back until they do. P.S. The fact that they didn't tell me about the shrimp paste the first time around is pretty disturbing.  Some people are allergic . . . ."
13616	71	4.0	1	2014-09-08	"What is wrong with people who gave this place bad reviews? Someone wrote ""too flavorful"" as a negative rev. Wait what? Since when is flavorful a failing? The dish I thought was delicious, bursting with flavors, an exciting party in my mouth. Mango salad was fresh, with a balance of sweetness and acidity, and of course like the streets of South East Asia- a pungent kick at the end. The strips of grilled chicken that came on top has a macho char, with spices like coriander seed, but then it's so juicy and delicate, perhaps due to having been basted  in a bath of coconut milk. The oyster with mantau was ingenious! Mantau was deep fried gleaming gold, and the sauce wakes you up. Your classic italian oyster dish should be very afraid. Khao soi was ok but not that impressive. That pumpkin soup (forgot the name) was sweet and silky smooth...my mind was quite blown. So perhaps Pig and Khao is not for the faint-tounged. Most definitely not for those who think that it is a Peruvian place. Pig and Khao, perhaps like the chaotic streets of South East Asia, can overwhelm you...the richness of coconut milk everywhere (including the good ole coconut rice) ,the pungent taste of fish sauce, the bird eye chili kick. But with an amazing balancing act by the chef and cooks, these bursts of deliciousness, and an open mind on your end, is a truly decadent experience. Ingenious without losing  the South East Asian authenticity. Thank you for a lovely meal Pig and Khao!"
13617	71	3.0	1	2014-09-07	One of the three dishes we ordered gets 4 stars though. The four stars is for their Khao Soi (curry, coconut milk, chicken, noodles). This was freakishly delicious. I could be biased here since I totally got a thing for noodz and curry. The noodles were hidden in this big bowl of curry broth and topped w/ crunchy wonton strips (I think it was wonton strips. I could be wrong) that pretty much stayed crunchy until we finished the bowl. They also put strips of an egg omelet on top. Best idea ever! The coconut taste was light and super faint, but I ain't complain'- it still worked. What did a have a really strong coconut flavor was their side coconut rice. I was expecting just a hint of it, but it definitely came out more like a dessert. I was about ready to ask for some mangos to put on top of it. It didn't work too well w/ our savory dishes. We also ordered the Sisig, which is pieces of pork head w/ a fried egg on top. The waiter recommended it and said it was one of the more popular items. Sorry, but I didn't really care too much for this. First bite was great, but any more after that just felt too heavy. Think pork belly minus the pork in terms of texture and taste and uh, pure fat. I might have needed a whole side of rice just for a couple pieces. What's cool about this place- $15 for all you can drink PBR. My PBR fans, come here and drink your little hearts out!
13618	71	1.0	1	2014-08-31	"Fusion at its worst. We came, excited by the positive reviews.  Peruvian food was something I'd just gotten into and was absolutely in love with.  Another favorite to add to my list?  I sure hoped so. Things just didn't work out from there, unfortunately. We ordered the Bahn Xeo, which is the sizzling crepe with shrimp, bacon, and bean sprouts.  The crepe itself was soggy and dripping in oil, and the sauce tasted as if it came from a pre-made container (probably did).  We also ordered the sizzling sisig after its raving reviews, but it should be called sizzling fat of leftover meat instead. The salty flavor made my taste buds cry in thirst hours afterwards, and the meat honestly seemed like the ""take everything leftover from the kitchen and douse it in sauce and sizzle it"" kind of dish.  The garlic rice was literally some garlic stir-fried into rice (go to Gyu Kaku for some legit garlic fried rice) and the sausage was fat with a side of sausage.   Afterwards, I was so hungry because there was nothing I really could eat (compare to being in China with only street food available and a desire not to get sick), thus forcing me to speed walk to Russ and Daughters (which saved the day, as expected). I'm giving this restaurant one star because of the wonderful outdoor atmosphere.  And because I can't go any lower in rating."
13619	71	5.0	1	2014-08-26	Amazing. The food here as divine and the service was spectacular. Try the Pork Belly and the Noodles and you will be so pleasantly surprised. The watermelon spiced cocktail was delicious as well. Can't go wrong here!
13620	71	2.0	1	2014-08-26	I will stop trying hipster Asian restaurants. I will stop trying hipster Asian restaurants. I will stop trying hipster Asian restaurants. These are notes to myself, but perhaps they will be useful to others.  Perhaps you too have been lured by blogosphere buzz and the insouciant air of the serving staff. Or perhaps you were drawn in by the slightly punishing music. The only problem is, well, the food. The coconut rice is very good.  The pork jowl with watermelon and chicharron is the kind of dish that sounds really cool but lacked the intensity of flavor you're expecting. The mango salad is adequate but nowhere near as good as the mango salad in Thai places in Elmhurst. It just lacks that burst of pleasure and complexity of flavors. Finally, we had the sizzling sissig, which receives so many raves on here. My wife and I find the enthusiasm for this dish bewildering. The ratio of fat to meat in the pork pieces is ridiculous. Even if you are fan of pork fat, eating this dish is an unpleasant experience. Essentially the only protein you're getting is from the egg that is cracked on top. Hipster asian restaurants feel to me like *concept* restaurants. You are going there to enjoy the *idea* of the food you are eating and to enjoy the idea about yourself as the sort of person who enjoys eating at that restaurant.  My own grubby materialism prevents me from partaking in this pleasure.
13621	71	4.0	1	2014-08-25	Loved this place! Small plates big enough to share! Coconut shrimp to die for! Mussels were pretty tasty and plentiful. Spicy noodle dish with chicken was just ok. Had the perfect storm cocktail and loved it! Prices on food are good for what you get, but cocktails, like everywhere in NY are expensive, but I'd even say this one was worth it!
13622	71	2.0	1	2014-08-24	"After dining here for the second time, I realized P&K's food is not consistent! My first experience was amazing which is why I wanted to dine here again. I was craving the sizzling sisig and wanted my friend to try it. We ordered the papaya shrimp noodle salad, sizzling sisig and mussels, and i was extremely disappointed with each dish. I felt so bad that I made my friend come here. I kept saying ""I swear this place was good before.""  *sad face* Papaya Shrimp Noodle Salad - flavor was overwhelmingly citrus-y, however, the shrimp was well done. Sizzling Sisig - Very greasy and oily, not crispy enough!! Mussels - broth was actually really good but too much broth, not enough mussels. We ate the broth with the coconut rice which was good."
12508	71	3.0	1	2014-08-24	I really do want to give more but I've had better sisig and its hard to justify a higher rating. Another one of my to try list after our original place was closed, we hopped over the across the street and Pig and Khao it is. On weekdays, they offer their 5 course tasting menu for $45. We opted for a la carte dishes such as sisig,  green mango salad, curry noodle with crunchies and half chicken. What saved this review was their halo halo dessert which is a must get. Shaced iced, condensed milk, purple ice cream, flan and rice krispy. Making a trip back for this only is worth it, everything else, I shall pass.
13623	71	4.0	1	2014-08-24	I went in there expecting really yummy food. I did not realize that they played music with explicit words so that was not cool as I had a young girl with me. I did like the food. Their coconut rice is to die for.
13624	71	5.0	1	2014-08-23	What an amazing first taste tonight! This place does it right with Asian food! We ordered the Papaya Noodle Salad, Pork Jowl with watermelon and fried pork skin and the Shan Noodles which was surprisingly more of a soup with ground chicken but all was delicious and the flavors packed a sweet punch :) Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. The ambiance was fun and casual and the place is definitely an inspiration for an aspiring restauranteur ;)
13625	71	4.0	1	2014-08-23	Another hip restaurant tucked away in the narrow streets of LES. This time it's Filipino/Thai fusion food.  It's pretty hot right now, so do make a reservation ahead of time. The first side of the menu is all small plates. On the other side, they have some large plates and sides. For 2 people, they recommend 2 small plates and 1 large one. Whatever you decide to do, get it with a side of coconut rice because my god, that shit is delicious as ffff. The thing is, it's pretty pricy at Pig and Khao. Small dishes are under $20 (but those are more like appetizers). Large dishes go for around $30. Cocktails are at least $12 and I think desserts are $8+  I would come here only for special occasions.
13626	71	5.0	1	2014-08-20	"I was very pleasantly surprised to find the food to be absolutely delicious. I've read so many reviews, both on and off yelp, that gave Pig and Khao mediocre reviews, so I was honestly a little nervous about trying this place. Do not be scared. Don't let the reviews or menu scare or intimidate you, you have to give this place a shot! The ""small"" plates aren't ""small."" They aren't tapas size which is what I thought and two would be good for a pair of regular sized stomachs. If your stomach is on the larger side (which mine is about 2X bigger than that), go 3 dishes and a bowl (or two) of coconut rice. You have to get the sizzling ssig. It tastes like pork, served on a sizzling plate with a raw egg that you mix in and cooks on the hot plate. You have to eat this with coconut rice which my coconut hating fiance even loved. We also had the shan noodles and the crispy pata (large dish but i thought it was small). Both were also good, but the shan noodles was on the smaller size and the crispy pata was very fatty, which is supposedly how it's served. I highly suggest the ssig and loved the shan noodles, but the crispy pata isn't a must. I went with two other friends who went and loved everything they ordered. There's so much variety on the menu and while it does look a big crazy, don't let it get to you. I'm a bit picky with flavors and this place mixes all the flavors very well so you aren't going to taste one thing more than the other. They blend everything together to make it perfect. Service is outstanding, they're very attentive and my glass of water was never half fulled. Absolutely loved it and will definitely be back!"
13627	71	2.0	1	2014-08-20	"::waves hand in a slapping motion:: Caught a table after work on a Tuesday night which seemed to be lucky as when I tried making reservations for this place in the past, It was never available during prime time. The place was empty cept for a few patron at the bar table area and some in the back outdoor ( who knew they had outdoor seating in the back? ). ::waves hand in a slapping motion:: Decor is somewhat spacious or so the design made it seem. Tables along the sidewall are way too close to each other as you had to be either stick skinny or move the table to the side if you're trying to get in or out. Points for the hip hop music being played. I'm noticing a trend with filipino restaurants in the LES and hip hop music. Love it. ::waves hand in a slapping motion:: Mon-Thurs is when PnK has their 45 dollar chef tasting menu. While this option seemed enticing, we decided to go ala carte since the menu wasn't that big anyway. ::waves hand in a slapping motion:: We ordered the sisig, green mango salad, khao soi and the chicken dish off their large plates section. Dessert was the halo halo. Food was less then memorable. Sisig was foodporn at its finest but overly salty. I've had better elsewhere. The char'd chicken that came with the mango salad was bland, the salad was slightly sweet with a heavy kick on acidity. Khao soi had a delicious curry broth with a nice kick to it. I could of done without everything else that came in this. Halo halo was the best of the night.  Shaved iced with sweet condense milk, rice krispies and a scope of ube ice cream. A must order if you're dining here. ::waves hand in a slapping motion:: Why am i waving my hand you ask? From about the time we sat down till 3/4 of meal was done, there was about 2 flies hanging around our area. When not buzzing around us, it was landing on other plate's setting next to us. That didn't seem to bother any of the staff and hey, if this was an actual restaurant setting instead of what to seemed to be a lounge with loud music then I wouldn't care either. Dishes took way too long to come out in between. Maybe it was a tactic to induce more drinks? Or maybe it was how full the restaurant was? Oh wait, it was barely full. I'll leave the conclusion to you . I really wanted to like this place but it falls short on expectation. Our waitress was a doll. ::waves hand in a slapping motion:: That's me signaling "" Pass"""
13628	71	4.0	1	2014-08-19	"Came here with my parents (big mistake).  I would definitely recommend this place but the ""hipster vibe"" seemed like a little too much for mom and pops.  Food was great, got the Khao Sao, Sig Sig, and Pork Jowl.  I loved the Khao Sao and Sig Sig but was not a huge fan of the Pork Jowl.  Service was kind of slow but I wouldn't take away a star for it.   I would definitely come back but with friends, not family."
13629	71	3.0	1	2014-08-16	Came as a group of six for a late Sunday brunch at 3PM - the sizzling sisig is apparently as good as other yelpers claim it to be (although really quite heavy, especially with a side of coconut rice). Two friends who ordered the Khao Soi (red curry with noodles) said that the dish was much spicier than expected, but not bad. The Longonissa Sausage was good, but really quite small. I ordered the green mango salad, which seemed to be a nice, refreshing and slightly acidic dish that contrasted the oily nature of the other dishes. I was satisfied with what I ordered, but overall Pig and Khao seems to warrant 3 stars.
13630	71	2.0	1	2014-08-15	Wasn't that big of a selection for dinner. Its either Ribs or Pork and that's it. Food was ok, but I personally wouldn't be running back anytime soon. The place itself was nice but just really not that much on the menu to choose from.
13631	71	3.0	1	2014-08-14	I really wanted to love this place and give it a high recommendation but thinking back to the overall dining experience there were more average dishes than above average. I went on Wednesday evening with reservation. It was quite busy but we were seated promptly (albeit a tiny corner two-seater for three). Ordered Papaya Noodle Salad, Grilled Pork Jowl, Pork Belly Adobo, the highly anticipated Sizzling Sisig, Khao's Pork Ribs and Halo-Halo as dessert. First, the Papaya Noodle Salad was very tasty but it was a bit too salty for me. I actually had a few bites with jasmine rice (Who eats noodles with rice?). The Grilled Pork Jowl was interesting with watermelon but lack of jowl made it more of a watermelon dish. The Pork Belly Adobo and Sizzling Sisig was the highlight. Although both had similar flavor, it was nonetheless very good. The Pork Belly was cooked to perfection and the soft poached egg was pro style. The Sizzling Sisig was equally worthy of praise and I love the texture when all mixed in. All was good until the much buzzed about ribs came. Simply put, it was just overwhelmingly sweet. The ribs were cooked very well but it was just smothered in their sweetest Asian sauce to date. The Asian cole slaw accompaniment didn't really help. I had almost two ribs with half bowl of jasmine rice. Not really what you want to do when eating good ribs. And for dessert, the Halo-Halo was expected and glad it was not too sweet. It was quite refreshing after the ribs. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience. The food was a bit of hit or miss but nothing too bad. The atmosphere is great for a small group get together - great for sharing. The unlimited self service Yuengling keg for $15 was a winner. The deco was a bit too try-hard Asian but not over the top.There's an open top dining court in the back. I would say if you like your food on the over-seasoned side then definitely go. If not, still go order yourself some rice with pork belly and sisig with some veggies on the side.
13632	71	3.0	1	2014-08-13	Had a reservation for 8PM for party of 20. Arrived at 7:45 and asked the manager if the table will be ready soon. The manager's attitude wasn't so great. He said our reservation is at 8 and they need time to set it up, so we will have to wait. Ok, but could of said it in a nicer way. I'm not rushing, but we have 20 people standing in front blocking their door. We sat around 8:20 supposedly because the people before us paid their check but didn't want to leave. Food was good, every dish was prefixed due to our large party. They forgot a few dishes so the manager said the kitchen will make additional 2 dishes to replace, but again with a nasty attitude. Overall we didn't feel welcomed. Our server wasn't around much to see if we needed anything or if everything was okay. The busboys couldn't help much, all they say is you have to ask your server. Well if she was around I wouldn't be asking you. Reservation was made a week before the dinner. They were not prepared and did not make us feel welcomed. Need better management. And the reason with 3 star is because food is not bad, and we still had a good time despite the service.
13633	71	5.0	1	2014-08-12	Yes yes yes. Pig and Khao is just quite wonderful. They do a very good job in selecting different delicious dishes from the Southeast Asian menu that make sense together. My personal favorites are the Sizzling Sisig, Halo-halo, and Young Cocunut Water w/ Rum.
13634	71	5.0	1	2014-08-12	Had a killer brunch here last weekend - service was very casual and very friendly. Food was delicious & exactly what i'm looking for when i hit a filipino spot. A nice fit for the LES. Offered bottomless beer & mimosas at $15 each and allowed us to hang for quite a bit - solid deal.
13635	71	3.0	1	2014-08-05	So...We came here and ordered the sisig, pork jowl and something else I forgot. Anyway, the pork jowl was the dish I was really looking forward to and unfortunately, I found a fat, live maggot in mine. At first I thought it was suppose to be there, (like those moving bonito flakes you find in okonomiyakis?) and I was about to eat THAT piece before I thought: wait a minute... It was quite large and stood on a piece of watermelon, literally waving at us. So we told the nearest guy we could find and turns out he was the manager, so he really took care of things. He asked me if I wanted to order something else and since it seems that the watermelon was the source of the maggot (everything else is cooked/heated), I had to choose something else instead of re-ordering the pork jowl. The nice part was that the entire meal was comped, that was totally unexpected. I also found relief that they told us they are double checking all the food to makes sure everything is okay (it is an open kitchen after all). It did leave a really uneasy feeling in us as we were really hesistant to eat anything, until the sisig came out (it's on this super hot sizzling platter, so that was safe..or at least dead). The sisig was alright, I think I like the one at Marhalika better. Super awkward, we left our waitress a tip and left. I think I will go back and hopefully have a much better experience!
13636	71	3.0	1	2014-08-04	Let me start by saying the ridiculous wait really turned me off. So best to make a reservation, I regretted not making one. It was pretty cool to see Leah Cohen from Top Chef working the operations in her own kitchen. I ordered the sizzling sisig with coconut rice which was the best dish in my opinion. Really enjoyed that. Also had the Khao Soi and Pork Belly Adobo. Both were just okay nothing special, probably wouldn't order again. What I don't understand is why they only serve the garlic fried rice for brunch! I may come back for brunch just for the sizzling sisig. Otherwise, I don't think I'd return.
13637	71	3.0	1	2014-08-03	3 friends and I came in on a Sunday afternoon with a 1:15 resso and the place was actually pretty empty. They have a back patio, which seemed like the more popular choice - but we were seated inside. I ordered the longanisa sausage, which came with a fried egg, and a tomato cucumber salad. This was kind of pricey, considering that the same exact dish I've ordered at other Filipino places came with an extra egg and a side of garlic rice for the same price. And on top of that, the sausage wasn't even that great. It was just salty. Didn't have much else flavor to it. The tomato cucumber salad had too much of whatever vinegar dressing they used. So I guess the best part of the dish was the fried egg? I also opted for the unlimited mimosas ($15) because what's a Sunday brunch without a little bit of day drinking, amirite?! And for those of you wondering if Pig and Khao will try to G you on the refills, they don't. Once your glass is almost empty, they come around and ask you which flavor you would like next. You can choose from orange, lychee, mango or watermelon. I skipped orange, since it was too boring. Passed on the lychee since I don't like lychee. Watermelon was okay. But the better one I tried was probbo the mango one. Probbo will not be back. There are better places for Filipino cuisine for a better value. (Check my review for Maharlika and Krystal's Cafe)
13638	71	2.0	1	2014-08-03	Definitely over hyped. It's a trendy spot for hipster/young crowd, but I will not be returning. Ambiance: Open kitchen, smelled delicious when we walked in! Good music, but it got loud around 8pm and we kinda had to yell and repeat ourselves in conversation. Empty at 6. Service: Ok they were attentive with refills. Food comes out at different times (told us after we ordered). My friends got their food roughly 15-20 minutes before I did. Food: Small portions; kinda like tapas. This is how they make $$ because you aren't really full with one if their small dish which average around $16. We got the pork with pork grind and watermelon dish (forgot name) which was zesty salty and sweet; lots of fatty pork... The mussels were very small and some of them were not opened. None of the dishes come with rice, jasmine rice is $3... The curry noodles-khao soi was salty because the noodle to soup ratio was off.... there was very small pieces of meat and mainly consisted of soup and what seemed to be the chinese preserved/pickled cabbage. As a result the taste was savory curry like and slight tang/sour from the cabbage leaves. Taste was decent but not enough ingredients to call it a good dish. We shared halo halo which was yummy. Piece of pudding, coconut meat, shave ice, rice crispy cereal, condensed milk, and banana? Good experience but don't recommend it if you're going out just to eat here, maybe if you happen to be in the neighborhood. Total cost: $63
13639	71	3.0	1	2014-08-02	I'm surprised that this place has such high ratings. Not saying that the food here isn't decent but it was definitely not up to par with the reviews I read here. Everything we ordered was just salty and the portion sizes were pretty small for the price we were paying. Unfortunately we will not be returning here any time soon. This place strikes me as a trendy spot that youngsters would go to try authentic Filipino food, but this is not the right place.
13640	71	3.0	1	2014-08-01	This is definitely not one of NYC's better Filipino places, but it's solid. The food is fine (overpriced), the atmosphere is cool, but if you want to go to a hip Filipino place go to Maharlika instead.
13641	71	4.0	1	2014-07-31	"If you go with a group of 6 hungry people, you can eat almost the entire menu. However, if there's just the 2 of you, here's my sample menu that will give you the best of what Pig and Khao has to offer: Mixed nuts- bits of coconut and a nut mix I've never had. Flavors abound! Khao Soi- The curry was spicy and amazing. I drank it like it was soup. The egg noodles were also divine. I would come here just for this dish Sig Sig- Not my favorite dish because it was a bit ""heavy"" for me, but the rest of the party enjoyed it so much they ordered a second plate. It was packed with flavor so you'll want to try this. Pork Belly Adobo- put an egg on anything and it's instantly delicious Side Notes: Green rice dorade- a nice respite from all the pork, but they were able to sneak in some chinese sausage. It's quite a large portion considering it is under the ""small"" plate section. The sauce/soup was nice and acidic and I drank all of it. Pork Jowl- This comes with chicharron so don't order the chicarron snack at the beginning of the meal.I liked having the refreshing watermelon between bites of all the pork. While tasty, it ranked lower on the list. Green mango salad- comes with noodles. Nice and acidic. Shan noodles- Reminded me of pho. Delish but if you're going to pick one noodle dish, choose the Khao Soi Crispy Pata- The skin was very crispy. This was my second favorite dish after the curry noodles. Very attentive staff and the food is quick to come out!"
13642	71	5.0	1	2014-07-31	Amazing food.  Great ambiance if you sit in the back in the outdoor seating section.  Helpful staff to help us go through the menu.  Especially great for meat/pork lovers!
13643	71	5.0	1	2014-07-29	Yum. Yum. Yum. Everything. This place has such exciting, happy flavors. Sizzling sisig and coconut rice - just as phenomenal as promised my Yelpers. The crispy pork belly with poached egg is a looker, but it was lacking in flavor compared to the sisig. Also, by the time the pork got to us, it was a bit cold. However, the pork skin was satisfyingly crispy, and the egg was poached perfectly.I think the star of the meal was the dessert. We got the halo halo because it sounded so foreign to us, but it's pretty much a taro-ish shaved ice with various condiments, such as flan, ice cream, Rice Crispies(TM), and various other Filipino items I'm not familiar with. There is some kind of tuber in there that I could have done without, but it's easy to eat around them. Green Mango salad was alright. The salad was great, but the chicken was so bland (perhaps compared to the savory dishes we had otherwise). Definitely coming back.
13644	71	4.0	1	2014-07-29	Very interesting little Asian fusion spot in the LES. It can be crowded but the food is pretty unique and worth the wait. I recommend getting the Khao Soi with coconut rice and maybe a side of pork jowl. Pricing is a little aggressive without being too unreasonable; stay away from the cocktails and stick with beer and you should be OK though. Expect it to be busy and noisy too. The counter is not a bad option (right in front of the cooking area) as it's a bit elevated and seems to rise a bit above the din.
13645	71	4.0	1	2014-07-28	Able to make last minute weekday dinner reservations and boy am I glad there was availability.  Great place, delicious food. A little loud and since the kitchen is out in the open, you'll come out smelling like food. Would definitely come again. What we got: Papaya Noodle Salad - tangy and pretty good Grilled Pork Jowl - the watermelon had a weird taste if you ate it without the pork/skin Pork Belly - delicious Sissig - my favorite Khao Soi - very good Coconut Rice - very good especially when you mixed with the sissig or Khao Soi curry Mantao Bun - good but wasn't expecting it to be salty Service: Good service and didn't rush us out while we were catching up.
13646	71	3.0	1	2014-07-27	Great lil hipster place to eat in the LES. The food is great but if you came here to get full of great Asian food beware! The Bill will rack up! To start off the night, we ordered a plate of amazing mussels and got ourselves a red solo cup (15 per person) for unlimited beer from the keg which was Yeungling for the day. We then ordered three small dishes and one large. In terms of portion wise I would call the small dishes ~extra small and the large dishes ~small. But the flavors were amazing! My personal favorite was the sizzling sisig that I was even tempted to get a second plate even for the steep price! The pork belly was very tender and flavorful but didn't seem to stand out much. The grilled sirloin was cooked well but a bit on the rubbery side for my taste. Paired with a regular Thai sweet sour hot sauce, it didn't seem to stand out to me. For dessert we ordered the halo halo to sample it out. We were kind of disappointed at how it compared to ones we had in Asia but it definitely had a Asian fusion kick to it and overall a tasty dessert to end the night.
13647	71	4.0	1	2014-07-24	everything is amazing! the coconut rice & sisig are my fav. kinda sad they replaced brussel sprouts with watermelon on the pork dish and the ribs sauce reminded me off caprisun (weirdly fruity). other than that, this place is awesome!
13648	71	2.0	1	2014-07-23	"I came here with my boyfriend last month without having made reservations. Pig and Khao is nestled away in the les so I figured if we were lucky enough to score a table, it wouldn't be as spacious as desired. Fortunately we were able to grab a ""table"" without waiting longer than two or three minutes. Our table was in between two larger groups and it was apparent that this table was added in to accommodate more guests. We were basically squished between the two groups. Too hungry to care, we flipped open our menus. We ended up ordering a viet coffee, watermelon canned beer, two small dishes (crab dish and noodle dish), a side of coconut rice, and pork rinds. The food was rather disappointing. I'm not sure if it's just because I  had high expectations or because I genuinely wanted to like the place. Either way the food wasn't great. The best part of our order was probably the pork rinds or the coconut rice, which is pretty sad. My boyfriend and I left pretty hungry and upset. Don't think we'll be returning...ever...again."
13649	71	4.0	1	2014-07-23	I still think about this place. First off let me start off by saying that just make a reservation, otherwise you may have to wait if it's a busy night. There is some strange deal where you can pay a lump sum and drink all the beer you want out of a shady cooler in the back yard. I ended up just getting a cocktail (Pigroni) and it was EXTREMELY strong and yet satisfingly enough girly that I could finish it. It's your typical LES restaurant: crammed, small, dim lighting, loud customers, and crazy good food. Pork belly adobo: Crunch exterior with my favorite juicy interior. I love pork belly. Sizzling sisig: My favorite dish of the night. I think perhaps the presentation helps but it comes out literally sizzling and crackling. The meat is flavorful, and I love blending it with the runny yolk egg. MMmm. Khao soi: If you like curry and you like noodles.. then this dish is for you. Perhaps not the best to get on a hot summer night. Green mango salad: I didn't realize they would serve you a hunk of chicken meat. I think we ordered this in hopes to counterbalance our extreme meatfest.. otherwise as long as you anticipate the pyramidal food chain balance, you should be fine. It wasn't anything special though, I would probably not order again. Coconut rice: Oh boy... why have I not had this before? Why why why? You are so delicious.. you creamy coconut you... It was so good I think we were thinking about ordering another portion. Oh so good. Oh so good. Come bring out the inner hipster in you and eat some Filipino/Asian fusion food.
13650	71	4.0	1	2014-07-22	Their food is so flavorful, distinctive in the city. Love it.
13651	71	5.0	1	2014-07-21	This is my current favorite restaurant. We've eaten here a dozen times in the past year. Everything is delicious -- but maybe particularly the shan noodles and grilled pork jowl -- and there's always a sweet classic hip-hop soundtrack playing.
13652	71	4.0	1	2014-07-17	Food is absolutely delish! But it is very over priced. Me and friends three of us could have a very nice Italian with how much we end up paying. But again, if you crave for coconut rice, here is a good spot
13653	71	4.0	1	2014-07-07	I looked this place up on Yelp because we wanted a lunch place close to where we were planning to take some photos.  It was a very nice day out, so we sat outside in the back, which was a very cute area. We got the: - Sizzling Corned Beef Hash: good, but was a little too salty for my taste - Sizzling Sisig: this was delicious - it was well cooked with the perfect amount of flavor - Khao Soi: this was very good as well.  Just be careful, it splatters when you serve yourself from the bowl!  Granted, this is a common occurrence for me (kiiind of a klutz...) - Garlic Fried Rice: yum! The service was great and the waiters were very friendly.
12709	71	1.0	1	2014-07-04	Might not be a fair review.  Had one item only.  Shan Noodles- think it was called- with ground chicken, tumeric and peanuts. Terrible taste to the broth. gave me a stomach ache.  Bad aftertaste that wasn't just from the spice.  Seriously worst bowl of noodles ever had.   Off day, off item, maybe but am glad it is all I tried.
5618	71	5.0	1	2014-07-03	One of my favorite brunch partners suggested that we hit up this LES gem the other weekend.  It can now be considered my new favorite brunch location next to Cafe Cortadito.  In addition to unbelievable food (tasty and inventive) you can also do $15 bottomless, serve-yourself PBR keg or bottomless mimosas (orange, mango, watermelon, lychee).  In case you read that too fast YOU CAN SERVE YOURSELF FROM THE KEG AS MUCH AS YOU WANT. There were four of us and we ordered family style (only way to do it because the plates are sizable).  We got the sizzling corned beef hash and grilled pork jowl which I thought were the two best.  We also got the shan noodles and khao soi which were also delicious I think I just wasn't in the mood for hot noodles on a hot day. Now if only they would open for lunch!!!!
13654	71	5.0	1	2014-07-02	YUM!!!!!!! The lovely BF suggested Pig and Khao on an ordinary Saturday evening, and I am SO glad he did. I was a little hesitant at first since I'm not a huge pork eater (all puns aside, the menu is very pork/beef heavy), but agreed since I've heard nothing but good things about P/K. The restaurant is small, but has a warm, clean and intimate feel. We were seated in the back garden patio, which was so perfect with the cute lights and artwork! I immediately noticed the keg - $15 for bottomless PBR is not a bad deal in NYC. We ordered the Genesee cream ale, the pork adobo, the cod in a banana leaf and the chicken curry with rice noodles. The pork adobo was pretty good - I love that it was served with a poached egg (my ultimate weakness). The cod was delicious as well, although a tad salty for my preference. IMO, the star of the show was the chicken curry with noodles. It was more similar to a soup, and almost reminded me of a more flavorful chicken pho. It was DELICIOUS!!! The Filipino and Burmese fusion spin definitely kicked the flavors up a notch. All in all, P and K is a great restaurant - loved the vibes and the food. The service was wonderful as well. Next time I hope to try the ube ice cream! :)
13655	71	5.0	1	2014-06-30	"Before eating at Pig and Khao the only exposure to pan-Laotian cuisine I had was at a Northern Thai restaurant that served Papaya salad which I almost died eating (I am deathly allergic to tropical fruits). After eating at Pig and Khao, I can't stop wondering why in my almost 30 years of being alive I haven't had more of it. Regardless of my personal ineptitude in seeking out Southwestern Asian cuisine, I am always intrigued to try anything ""Filipino."" I was reading some Delta Airline magazine a while back about how Filipino chefs are starting to branch out and become more aggressive about starting up restaurants, selling food, etc. Whereas their entrepreneur spirit hasn't quite reached the same level as their Asian neighbors from the East (Thai, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, take your pick) I think Pig and Khao is a wonderful step in the right direction. My two friends and I stepped into P&K on a hot Sunday afternoon. The restaurant is tucked into an inconspicuous corner next to some Chinese grocery stores midway into Clinton St. so at first I was questioning whether we were walking the right direction, but the chalkboard signs outside and the glaringly Filipino designs bursting out of the doors next to the bar area reassuring told us that we were in the right place. I immediately cringed when my friend said we wanted to sit outside because of the weather that we had walked in to get to the restaurant -- turns out their outdoors seating area has a nice shady awning with an industrial sized fan which quelled any further reservations about outdoors seating. And of course the food. We came here during lunch/brunch hours so the menu was slightly limited than usual -- they had all the Filipino classics including corned beef hash which I fully intend to come back for next time I'm back in the neighborhood. Out of their carefully enumerated collection of Filipino-Laotian offerings, we chose to go with the Sizzling Sisig, the Khao Soi, the Shan Noodles, with sides of Garlic Fried Rice and Longanissa sausage. All of their offerings were superb -- The Sizzling Sisig with egg was the perfect blend of crunchy, chewy, and fatty gluttonous pork; the pig face somewhat reminded me of a crispy rendition of chiraga (Okinawan boiled/fried pig face dish). Give the egg about three to four minutes before mixing it into the ingredients and it meshes gloriously with the pork fat and the savory/sour seasoning (I tasted minuscule amounts of goya/tamarind with every bite.) The Khao Soi probably stole the show for three guys that have never had the dish before -- the curry was flavorful but not overbearing; I like the concept of serving semi-hard egg noodles with a heavy-ish broth, which allows you to really taste the depth of flavors at different stages of ""cooking."" (i.e. slightly bland when the noodle is still hard -- maximum penetration of flavors when the noodle becomes soft.) I personally thought the Shan noodles were what did me in; the sauce/broth had a very distinct fermented flavor but was refreshing at the same time -- I thought all the toppings came together very well. I wasn't overly satisfied with the garlic fried rice here and the longanissa was, well, longanissa -- blame me for liking bland-ish food, but I think the sour/tamarind flavor could have been absent from the already flavorful garlic fried rice. Overall, P&K provided us with an amazing dining experience -- I can't wait to come back and try some of their dinner offerings (I love me some adobo) and their corned beef hash."
9272	71	5.0	1	2014-06-29	The khao soi is the thing to get. The crunchy noodles soften in the curry but still maintain texture leaving you with something great. The sizzling sisig is full of fatty, crunchy, pig face and the portion is somehow almost too big. Share that or just accept that your cholesterol is going to double. The shan noodles, compared to the other dishes work as more of a palate cleanser and the picked veggies balance it all out. I'm in it to it and want to go back. Def do that khao soi tho.
13656	71	5.0	1	2014-06-28	The best. You can order anything on the menu and it'll be spectacular. The sizzling sisig is a must, of course, but honestly even the pasta dish is good. Be careful with the spiciness--if you are highly sensitive, be explicit because at Pig/Khao, medium spice the equivalent of mouth-burning elsewhere. Make a reservation and don't be surprised if you have to wait still if you get there. It's worth it.
13657	71	2.0	1	2014-06-28	"The menu is small, they have a section for small plates and larger plates. The small plates were $15 each, and the larger ones were around $20 something. I ordered 3 small plates, thinking it would be able to fill 2 people up, but boy was I wrong when the servers brought it to my table. The food was literally the size of my palm. Such small portions. Who are they trying to feed, dawrfs? They should replace the word ""small"" with bite size. The food tasted good, but I feel like for what I'm paying it could've been better. I also had to get up to walk over to the front to flag my waitress down a couple of times since they sat us all the way in the back in their outside back area. I'm just saying if you're super hungry, and want attentive workers, don't come here. It's a waste of your time and money. BUT if you want something a bit on the pricey side to munch on while drinking, and want to be left alone forever, this could be your spot to go to."
13658	71	4.0	1	2014-06-23	Stopped by this place on the Bon Appetit Grub Crawl on Friday. I loved everything about this place. Top three reasons why I'd come back are: 1) Staff 2) Vibe 3) Food The staff was so friendly, the owner was so chill and sweet. The staff are obviously having a great time and love what they do - which is so refreshing and fun. The staff were dancing around and having an awesome time and just loving life, which was contagious. The vibes here are great. I loved the outdoor space with the DJ. Nothing felt too contrived. Food was off the charts good. I had the ribs and bbq chicken wings. then they gave us these watermelon drinks. Yummmmm!
13659	71	2.0	1	2014-06-21	ew. i mean r u kidding me? why has it gotten so many high reviews?!?!?!? im literally baffled. we came here for lunch (ok so maybe that's why) and the menu is vastly different from the dinner listings bc several items i wanted was in fact, no available. but we did get the highly rated sissling sisig and.....yeah? what's so great about it. like do people just say it's good cuz some dude on yelp said it's good? I mean it's not bad but like....it's not a standout or knockout BY A HUGE MARGIN. restaurant is incredibly small as is many restaurants in LES, EV but i mean....the food's so mediocre.... i was seriously let down. maybe i didn't order the right stuff but when you're in a restaurant rich city like nyc, this is one i'd have no time or desire to visit again. better fushion places include cafe asean and bao haus.
13660	71	5.0	1	2014-06-20	I've been to Pig and Khao twice now and honestly can't wait to go again. Both times we've had fantastic food, great service and an all around enjoyable meal. The most recent visit we ordered what I think must be a new dish of squash and delicious curried broth which we paired with coconut rice, sisig (amazing) and this rice crusted fish that was delicious despite being a little difficult to eat. The squash was amazing - so flavorful. It honestly might have been my favorite dish of the evening. The sisig is amazing - pretty salty but I love the flavors. The fish had a unique flavor in the broth and the sweet chinese sausage was a nice touch. Love this place - can't wait to go back!
13661	71	3.0	1	2014-06-15	Sitting in the back yard with a Sissling Sisig in front of me and all the Genesee I can drink is a special kind of happiness.   The menu can be adventurous for some (it's Asian fusion more than pure Filipino food) but I personally relished the opportunity try some tasty pig ears and curry lamb ribs. A bit loud at times, but lots of fun.
12468	71	3.0	1	2014-06-13	This was my first time having filipino food so I didn't really know what to expect of it. The restaurant was small and cozy, so its a pretty chill place to eat at. The service was really good. The servers always constantly refills your water and never lets it get half way through. What I ordered (For 2 people): Khao Sao: It was really spicy for me, so if you can't handle spicy.. Do not get it. Its a chicken curry noodle dish topped with crispy noodles. Nothing spectacular so I wouldn't recommend it. Sisig: Ordered this because it was recommended on yelp by a lot of people. This dish was the best out of all three dishes we had, so i would recommend it. Pork Belly Adobo: I did not like this dish at all. The pork belly had a weird foul taste to it. My friend and I both ate one piece and didn't even bother eating the rest because it was just appetizing. For dessert, we ordered the Halo Halo. The ice cream was  probably the best part of this. We basically just ate the ice cream and that was that. We spent $75 (tip included)  for 2 people and overall, it was alright for my taste.
13662	71	4.0	1	2014-06-13	I'm Filipino. Which really means nothing, because I'm convinced I'm black. I didn't come here looking for traditional Filipino, cuz it ain't a Flip joint. I really just wanted to use the bathroom. That said, It's Asian fusion with a hip vibe. The vibe: Didn't have a reservation and were seated immediately on a Tuesday night around 7. Busy, controlled chaos. Modern, young staff with hip hop playing overhead and just on the cusp of being too loud. It's not meant to be a place for intimate dining. First date worthy cuz those quiet/awakward moments are hidden under the performance around you. Sat inside and typical seating in terms of closeness to neighbor.   The food: Winner. The pork belly adobo with its crisp skin and delicious homey broth was the highlight. Sure it's fatty but if you don't love that, then you're a waste of space. The muscles were fresh and again the sauce was spectacular. Scallops that was a special that night were cooked well and dope. The mango salad was good. The beers and drinks were aight. Service: Attentive and friendly staff.  Had multiple servers which was odd at first but it worked out. Never needed to ask for more water. Plates were taken away quickly and food was brought out in a timely manner. Cons: I hate sitting in confined tight places. The end. In the end: Three of us had two rounds of dranks plus all the food and bill was $125 ish... not bad. I'd mos def come back to try rest of menu out.
13663	71	5.0	1	2014-06-08	Sat at the chef's table.  EVERYTHING was amazing - flavorful and unique dishes.  My husband went crazy over the coconut rice.  The sirloin was outstanding.  The service was great.  The staff was friendly and helpful in answering the few questions we had. Also, they were playing great old school hip hop music while we were there.
13664	71	3.0	1	2014-06-01	Fried chicken wing with south Asian curry. The exterior tastes like hot sauce with a slight curry flavor but the chicken wing itself is bland and flavorless. Mussels-wish the broth was more fragrant and savory. It's just a lil lemony not memorable. Khao Sao- Rice noodle with chicken in a curry broth. Topped with crispy fried noodle (the type the Chinese take out gives you with soup). We had to return this dish because the chicken was raw on the inside. The chicken pieces were quite small and it's in broth, I don't understand how it can be undercook and raw on the inside. BBQ ribs- after my short essay, I have no comment for this dish. Complimentary halo halo which was delicious and superior service makes up for  the whole raw chicken fiasco.
13665	71	5.0	1	2014-05-29	"Leah is a skilled genius! I love to come here with friends at least twice a month.   The Sisig is my go to!  The curry, mussels are also BombA** good!!! Music brings me back to my younger days, and makes for a fun background noise.   Everyone I bring here (and I have brought over 60 different people) come back with their friends or families ""to taste this amazing menu!"""
5668	71	4.0	1	2014-05-25	I'm finding Filipino food to be more and more appetizing each time I try it. The flavors are always so explosive and exciting. I rather enjoyed the food I had here, although my pleasure was much interrupted by a delay in my order. Apparently there was a screwup with the technology and there was no food for about 50 minutes. Grr. (The make good was a dessert. Would have much preferred a discount than more food.) Anyway. Screwups aside, the food was pretty tasty. Don't get the chicharron though; it's not particularly flavorful and I was expecting something with a bit more crisp and less staleness. But just about everything else I tried was pretty good! I never thought I was an eggplant person, but the eggplant salad was just the right balance of mushy and crunchy from the nuts. The sisig is cut into small pieces so you don't have to tirelessly chew away at pig ear, and the sauce was very yummy. I was full but I kept picking at it with the bowl of fragrant and sweet coconut rice I ordered, which was so worth the extra calories. The Khao Soi was like Chinese yee mee noodles in a curry sauce. It was tasty but nothing special. The complimentary dessert was the turon. I didn't really care for the spring roll style banana fritters. The salted caramel ice cream was good but the chocolate sauce threw all the flavors off. I got a spicy cocktail that had a salt rim, and it was actually spicy, so that was good. If I ever come back here, I'll just be ordering a plate of sisig and a bowl of coconut rice and could leave happy and content.
13666	71	2.0	1	2014-05-24	Went here last week for a birthday brunch. Various emails had been exchanged between my party's host and the restaurant staff arranging for a patio table for our party. Upon arrival, the hostess, a rigid and not at all accommodating young woman had no idea we would be arriving. We were offered champagne to make up for her horrendous welcome towards us, but this did not make up for the 45 minute wait ahead of us for our table. Once we were seated, out experience was much more pleasant, as our server was experienced and kind. Unlimited mimosas were wonderful in various flavor options and the food was unique and extremely flavorful. We had the sizzling sisig (a must try!), banh xeo, mango salad, steak and egg, khao soi curry, garlic rice and brioche French toast. Highly recommend all of these choices as they were unlike anything we had eaten before and very good. Unfortunately the unpleasant hostess continued to interfere with our table and took drink orders that never arrived to our table. All around the experience was great from a culinary point of view but the service needs tremendous increases in training and all around spirit.
5658	71	3.0	1	2014-05-20	Decided to try filipino food and chose Pig and Khao over Maharlika. Wrong move. I might of ordered the wrong dishes, but heres what I chose: 1) Sizzling Sig 2) Pork Belly Adobo 3) Coconut Rice 4) Crispy Pata (1) First dish came. Looked fantastic with the egg and different spices and flavors. Had fantastic first few bites, then it became really heavy; it was literally 30% meat, 70% cartilage/fat. Then (2) came. Pork belly wasn't good; slices were too big, and 80% of it was fat. Not enjoyable. We tried to offset the overly rich(?), greasy taste of pork fat/cartilage with the (3) coconut rice but as an asian, rice shouldn't be this sweet. It was like they drenched it with candy and sugar. Very odd. Final dish came (4), and surprise - more pork fat/cartilage. Couldn't do it. Had 1 bite and almost threw up. I was so grossed out by the restaurant I couldn't even look at the food anymore. We really wanted to try the Halo Halo dessert, but honestly, I just wanted to get out of there and go eat something to wash off the taste of pig fat. We asked for the check and rushed out. Service was super nice though - hence the 3 stars. They took the (2) Crispy Pata off the menu because they saw that we barely touched it. Much appreciated. Overall, this was my first filipino experience, and I really wished I chose to go to that other joint in the East Village. PS. They have a garden in the back. It's quiet compared to the very lively dining room, but nothing special. Too dark for dinner. Would be nice for lunch.
13667	71	4.0	1	2014-05-18	This place was fantastic the first couple of times we went, but felt a little tired the last time.  The sizzling sisig, coconut rice, and the green mango salad are amazing.  The staff is cool and I love that the have cheap beer.  Overall, a good place, but I hope they keep up the intensity and get rid of their B rating.
13668	71	5.0	1	2014-05-18	Bestie lives around this joint, we came one night for dinner. Small little place, big on flavors! Wow! Jo immediately tells us what to order since shes been here before. I was too carried away by the food that I did not take a second to check out the decor. 1. Sizzling Sisig, one of their top sellers, lives it up to its name! Dish came to our table still sizzling, sunny egg on top was still trying to cook. Fatty succulent pork in the chili type sauce, with the yolk dripping down, was unbelievable. 2. Baby Back Ribs, cooked till almost falling off the bone. It's got a nice chew to it, don't think it would taste as great if they cooked it even longer. They use their own blend of special bbq sauce, off the hook! Asian slaw had a tangy dressing. 3. Khao Soi, you can taste the coconut, never had better red curry! Egg noodles cooked perfectly, chicken was tender. Even after we killed the noodles we ordered a bowl of their coconut rice to finish off the curry sauce. 4. Pumpkin Barrel, waitress recommended us this  after I mentioned I'm more of a beer person. And I gotta say it was good, malty, barely and pumpkin is very settled. Never tried or even heard of this one before. Checkout their drink menu, they have an assortment of Asian beers as well as cocktails. I know surely the next time I'm here, I'm ordering everything!

13670	71	4.0	1	2014-05-16	Wow!!! A tiny place on lower east side that serves amazing food. Four of us did their tasting menu, which meant we got just about everything on their menu.  The Burmese Eggplant Salad, Pork Belly Adobo, and Green Rice Crusted Dorade were our favorites.  Next time we're in NY, we are definitely going to do their suckling pig dinner.
13671	71	5.0	1	2014-05-15	Creative, happy, delicious food
13672	71	3.0	1	2014-05-14	I'm not crazy about crispy skin pig which seems to be all that everyone talks about when reviewing Pig and Khao. I didn't come very hungry and just ordered garlic rice and a side of longanisa sausage for brunch which are both staples when it comes to Filipino food. Both were great except I literally poured a small dish full of oil from my rice, which was really unappetizing! Other dishes I've tried include the sizzling corn beef hash and Khao Soi (red curry). Not bad but nothing worth remembering. I still rank Maharlika over this place! Though it might be a tiebreaker between their playlists. Alternative rock/oldies vs. Old school hip hop- hard to choose!
13673	71	5.0	1	2014-05-14	I found this place by pure accident on a day when I was waiting for a friend's meeting to be over. I intended to walk down the street to a bakery, but after turning the corner and walking about 5 feet, I was confronted with an irresistable smell of MEAT. It was undeniable that someone, somewhere nearby was making something absolutely delicious with MEAT. I about-faced and that is when I found Pig and Khao. It wasn't even time for a meal, but the call of meat was not to be ignored. I ordered the bottomless mimosas (Lychee) (and yes, I will not infrequently decide impromptu that a day requires bottomless mimosas) and the pork jowl. Pork Jowl was amazing from the first bite to the last. The pork was rich in flavor and texture, and it comes in a bed of roasted brussel sprouts with some kind of a vinegar tangy sauce that is just heaven with the heaviness of the jowl. Also, while I was eating, I noticed that some other people ordered some other dish that smelled like meat heaven, and I was insanely jealous. If i didn't have a lunch obligation in less than an hour or if I had chugged more mimosas to cloud my judgement, I would have ordered that too, OORR walked over and asked if I could just have on teentsy bite of theirs. Whatever that was, order it. Ask the server what the amazing smelling sizzling meat fit for gods and goddesses is called.
13674	71	5.0	1	2014-05-13	I didn't have their food, but 5 stars to Pig & Khao because on a warm relaxing day, here i was strolling around madison sq park and thinking how nice it would be to have a cold refreshing drink, and then in no time, someone is chopping up a fresh young coconut and puts a straw in it, and i'm sipping on this sweet sweet coconut water like i'm on some tropical island. Oh and I literally just got back from maui, and even maui coconut was not as sweet and yummy as this... so 5 stars! for amazing quality coconut in the middle of manhattan!
13675	71	3.0	1	2014-05-11	Went here on Mother's Day a table of 6, they put us outside in the rt corner, the garbage stench was so bad we moved inside , they cranked the rap music up so loud , we could not here ourselves talk.... The food took extremely long and not all of the dishes came out at the same time, with the last dish coming out when most others had finished .... The food was great however, chicken curry was great, as well as mimosas, not sure we will go back.....
13676	71	5.0	1	2014-05-09	This place is one of my favorite restaurants at the moment. I've been here twice and I'm wondering when's the next time I'll be back. I tried as many of their dishes as I could, and I can honestly say I was a fan of everything. The food here is so good and comforting. The one dish I recommend that everyone should get is the sizzling sisig, the aroma of this dish is so enticing. This dish is a classic in Filipino cuisine. The pork jowl is one of my faves, especially if you're a roasted brussel sprouts lover like me. You might overlook the coconut rice, but please don't. It's as strong as any other dish, the best I've ever had. The khao soi is great if you want noodles and heat! It was a bit too spicy for me but I'm weak when it comes to spicy foods. Their mussels dish is unique in a sense that it's served with a sweet pineapple curry broth and deep fried baos for dipping. The crispy pata is slightly elevated than the traditional dish, but very good especially with the liver sauce that's served. The flan and Ube ice cream is amazing in their halo halo. I honestly love every dish. The environment is very chill and embodies the personality of the workers. Also, if you're a Top Chef fan, you can see contestant Leah Cohen cook and run her open-spaced kitchen. I was fangirling the whole night lol.
13677	71	3.0	1	2014-05-08	3 stars only because I was expecting a kick in the spice from the Pork Belly Adobo. Other than that, I think the menu definitely has variety. You can go from purely Filipino food to a fusion dish. I ordered Sisig, Crispy Pata and the Pork Belly Adobo. Sisig is different and had a distinct flavor (good!), crispy pata was not as moist but still delicious and Pork Belly Adobo, well, was a bit disappointed - I should probably request addl Szechuan corns. Nonetheless, I would definitely come back again, my experience was positive here. Make sure to do reservations because the place does get packed. Also, service here is pretty top notch so expect to get the waiter/waitress checking in a lot.
13678	71	5.0	1	2014-05-06	I wanted to provide an update to my previous 5-star review for Pig and Khao. I went again for a Saturday dinner and it was such a great spot for my coworkers and I to have bonded over food and drinks. It was a bit on the louder end, with a few of the other tables getting a bit rowdier than I anticipated, but nonetheless, it added to my dining experience. In my previous review, I did not mention the sisig and the spicy coconut chicken wings, which in fact are two of my favorite things on the food menu. The sisig is a larger dish that is very shareable between two, even among groups of 3 to 4 people. It is served on a sizzling hot stone with diced up pork head meat and don't be scared off by the words 'pork head' because it is delicious! The pieces of ear, snout, and belly are sautéed in a tamarind-like sauce, very mild, and served with a goeey egg, raw yolk and all, on top. You mix it all up and have it with a side of rice, or coconut rice, which I do. The coconut rice is on the sweeter side, so it goes very well with the savoriness of the sisig. The spicy coconut chicken wings are a smaller appetizer that comes with 4 pieces to one order. The wings are very similar to buffalo wings, but with a sweet coconut after taste at the end. It's not sautéed with a dry rub nor is it like Korean fried chicken that we all are too familiar with, so Pig and Khao's chicken wings are a great twist to the traditional all-American wings that we all love.
13679	71	4.0	1	2014-05-04	I ordered the Khao Soi, mussels, and pork belly adobo. Flavor-wise, everything was great; a tad salty (should've ordered a beer; would've been perfect). Service was great and the food came out relatively fast. The walls are green. Music is all rap/hiphop. Reminded me of Baohaus a little. I would say Pig and Khao is like the Thai, sit-down, restaurant version of Baohaus. Definitely want to try this place again and maybe next time get seating in the back patio. I'm a sucker for back patios.
13680	71	4.0	1	2014-05-03	This place was absolutely delicious. Some friends and I went on a hunch that it was going to be good, and it did not disappoint. We were 4, and their recommendation was to get 4 small plates and one large plate. We did well with the 4 small plates, but with a bigger appetite, the ribs looked mighty fine. Sizzling sisig was fabulous! My favourite of the 4. All the absolutely delicious edible parts of a pig head with a cooking egg on top. Pork belly adobo was a close second. An explosion of flavour with an appropriate amount of crispness of the skin.  Khao soi was okay. Good flavour curry, but the crispy soggy noodles on top-ish lowered the quality. My least favourite was the Shan Noodles. Too much heat, not enough flavour! All in all, I will definitely be a repeat customer, ambiance was fantastic.. Service, on point.. Food, delicious! Keep it up!!
13681	71	4.0	1	2014-04-30	Service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and easy going. They came to check up on us very often to see if everything was ok. The menu was very limited so we had no problem choosing what to eat right away. For a party of three we ordered three small dish and one large one. The dishes came out swiftly since it was a quiet Wednesday evening. The sizzling sisig was pretty flavorful with different textures. Some were soft, some were crispy and other parts were just chewy. It was a little too salty for eating straight up without rice. The cod in the banana leaf was cooked perfectly. They were not kidding when they meant small plate. The khao soi which was the red curry with coconut milk and egg noodles. I am not a big fan of red curry so I didn't try it. From looks it was mostly fried noodles on top and very little egg noodles. We also order the crispy pata which reminds me of the crisp roast pork from Chinatown. It wasn't very impressive. A hundred dollars later I felt like we filled up on coconut rice more than anything else. Pig & Khao is the type of place where I would go once or twice to taste everything.
13682	71	5.0	1	2014-04-30	Food was amazing. All the employees were attentive, helpful, and super friendly. The bartender came over to my table to ask if I liked the drink he made me (I did... It was delicious).  It has a young hip vibe... You can order bottomless PBR and they give you a solo cup and direct you to a keg outside.  The music was mostly rap (Tupac, Kendrick, etc) which is a first for me at a restaurant but weirdly fit the place perfectly (it wasn't loud or obnoxious). Literally my only complaint is that I thought the tasting menu was too much food but that's hardly a thing to complain about. We just took home leftovers.  Not sure I'd classify it as a $$ kind of place... Maybe $$$. Our bill was $150 before tip for 3 cocktails, 1 bottomless PBR, and 2 tasting menus. It was a fair price for everything we got though.  The Sizzling Sisig and Grilled Pork Jowl were our favorites. Fantastic place, would definitely go back (and I don't even live in NYC).
13683	71	3.0	1	2014-04-29	Megh- nice interior and wait staff. Had the Khao Soi and was not blown away. It was a pretty one note dish, it just tasted like hot curry broth with noodles and a few pieces of chicken. The pickled mustard greens where blah, had no bite to them at all. Maybe the other food is a bit more exciting.
13684	71	4.0	1	2014-04-25	I can't get over this place! It'd get 5 stars if it wasn't so expensive. When (not if) you go you have to get the sisig pig and the khao sai. Service is on point annnnnd so is the cilantro soda.
13685	71	3.0	1	2014-04-24	Met up with some people here for brunch on a Saturday. For some reason, our reservation never went through so they had set us up with tables outside. Tables were all filled when we sat down. So business here is good but not overwhelming. Also, there were no heat lamps outside (it was kind of chilly). I had the sizzling sisig and some of the khao soi. Both were okay. The sisig was pretty heavy after eating it - and needed rice to go with it. The waiters also emphasize family style strongly but having 1 dish to yourself is totally fine and enough (We didn't follow their suggestions haha). The food was different from what I typically eat, and I'd say it was ok. I also got the viet coffee - good, but it's on the sweet side. Overall, It was ok to try.
13686	71	4.0	1	2014-04-21	I came here for Boozy Brunch on a Sunday around 12pm when visiting my sister. We had reservations but the restaurant was pretty empty at the time. The food: The food here is great!! And they have bottomless mimosas for $15. My sister has taken me to Marhalika (obsessed!!) but the wait there is always ridiculous. Pig and Khao is a great alternative. I got the grilled pork jowl, my sister got the longonissa sausage with a side of garlic rice and we shared the powdered sugar donuts. Their garlic rice is SO GOOD...yum. I would give their food five stars for taste. The service: I can't give Pig and Khao five stars overall because of their service. The workers are extremely nice, just really, really slow. We spent almost 2 hours there, and we were probably eating for about 15 minutes of that time. Although its bottomless mimosas, they are really slow in bringing you refills. Whenever we needed anything, we had to wait a really long time for anyone to come by, maybe their were understaffed? They weren't that busy so its hard to understand why. I would give them 3 stars for service. It's definitely a great place for brunch if you arent in a rush and are patient. It has a nice little back patio area, which my sister said is rare in NY. She'll definitely be coming back!
13687	71	5.0	1	2014-04-20	One of the best restaurants I've been to in NYC, though it should be noted that I'm biased toward Thai food and don't have unlimited money like some more well-fed NYC diners. I had three small plates for two people, plus the coconut crack I mean rice.  All big portions.  Everything perfectly cooked.  Dorade crusted with green rice? What is green rice even? Like only the green ones picked from the rest of the Fruity Pebbles?  Whatever, it stayed crusty while sitting in a rich, buttery broth with cockles and Chinese sausage and perfectly cooked bok choy and andjfcicuskdbsiw just eat it Very reasonable prices considering the portion size and quality of the cooking.  Creative combinations of ingredients.  Casual environment that didn't at all mind the slurping noises my face made.  I think I kept slurping after I was out of curry because my face wanted more and generally I obey my face. The manager was wearing a sriracha shirt.  Leah Cohen was expediting dishes like a bauce.  Eat everything.
13688	71	5.0	1	2014-04-20	This is one of the best restaurants in NYC that I have been to and everything that was eaten was beyond delicious! I came here for a friends engagement party and we had a pre fix menu for 12 that was so filling (we all had the itis by the time we left from all the food we ate).   We started with the pork rines with vinegar which was followed by the cod in the banana leaf. The cod, although small in portion, was so good. AND THE COCONUT RICE!!!!!! I'm telling you that this rice was put of this world! Everyone was googling how to make it because it was like crack! The sizzling sigsig was also really good too! So now I'm at my halfway point but we have more food coming out! The Khao Soi curry was really good and mixed with the coconut rice was to die for! For the entree we had the BBQ Ribs and they were so juicy they just fell off the bone. For dessert with had the halo halo and who new shaved ice with taro ice cream, flan, and over stuff could be so good! You must come here and eat as you will not be disappointed! For a pre fixe menu for 12 with 6 courses (and the $10 all you could drink beer) it came out to $45/person.
13689	71	2.0	1	2014-04-19	I mean is it just me? How did this chick even make it to Top Chef? Honestly, I'm not here to burn and and will get to the point in a second but I used to know a bunch of Asian chicks from San Fran that loved this place and used to invite me there for happy hour. Never went because it seemed out of the way. Then, my girlfriend saw Leah Cohen on TV, said she wanted to go and when we happened to walk by it, by chance, a few nights later we decided to give it a try. So.....here's the deal: Service-perfectly fine. We walked in on a Saturday night without reservations and they sat us Menu-server indicated it was a family style and that all plates were meant to be shared. Menu divided into two categories: small and large, with the emphasis being on small. Irrespective of category, the main missing component was flavor. The red curry wings had zero heat and a taste more reminiscent of grocery store bottled curry than anything else. The crispy pata won points for the texture of the skin but was as flavorless as the two boring sauces that were served as accompaniments. Better off going to a $10 Puerto Rican spot if you want pork like this. The saving grace was the dessert but then again you could find something remarkably similar to this for less money in Chinatown or fort lee. Super disappointing Booze-do I expect to find in a place like this an offer for serve yourself unlimited pbr draft for $15? If this is to do compensate for the poorly conceived menu, then at least offer something more tolerable than cheap college swill. On the other hand, the pigroni was a nice drink....if only they could offer it to go. I just don't get the hype surrounding this place. I worked in the restaurant business for years and inherently want to see small restaurants do well but the food here was just a tremendous letdown. Do yourself a favor and don't go.
13690	71	3.0	1	2014-04-19	"I have to say I'm not sure what the fuss is about here. I will start off by saying the staff here is really attentive an personable, I thought the service was excellent.  Trust in this small space that is something that is no small feet. In regards to the food I LOVE spice so when something comes ""spicy"" I expect a kick. No kick here, moving on to the pork. Everyone knows even Anthony Bourdain will tell you best pork is made by Philippino's  & Puerto Ricans, we lika' some pork!!! However this pork was lack luster, it had no flavor & the sauces were bland. Nice taste but overall not living up to the hype. So in short the mixed drinks are pretty good, service is excellent, portions are NOT family style get your own plate & while the composition of flavors are there it's missing something. SPICE!!"
13691	71	3.0	1	2014-04-16	Went for a group brunch. Was pretty excited based on reviews to try the unlimited mimosas and sizzling sisig. Had a bunch of their dishes but nothing was really outstanding. Everything tasted ok. I just wasn't overly impressed, the portion sizes were small, the prices high, and the service relatively slow. Mimosas were also very weak. I'm not a fan of fatty pork and a lot of their pork was rather fatty. Prob wouldn't go again for brunch. Also, was rather hot in the restaurant. They had no AC going, just a fan. Not sure how they handle the summer heat. They had an outside eating area though that looked like it would be nice to sit on.
13692	71	4.0	1	2014-04-13	Love Maharlika. Some dishes are better than others on the menu. But the combination of ambience, sisig and old school hip hop cannot be beat. The sisig is one of the best I've had outside of the Philippines. Ask them for a side of Birdseye thai chilis to add a little punch. Other dishes I've had that I recommend: crispy pata, khao soi and the corned beef hash during brunch. Only item I've ever had that was just meh was their fried fish dish (wasn't that great). Otherwise the service is always super friendly and they take reservations so you can save yourself the wait time.
13693	71	5.0	1	2014-04-10	By far the best sizzling sisig in the city. Kao soi is surprisingly good and spicy. Save room for dessert, Halo Halo is to die for. Soda is free refill. I first got a deal from google offer to try Pig and Khao and I became a regular ever since. If you like Pig and Khao, also try Fatty Crab. They now take reservation which is great.
8870	71	2.0	1	2014-04-08	I went in for dinner on Sunday night and haven't felt well since...almost 2 days later.  The menu wasn't as good as it has been in the past, and the food wasn't prepared as well as I have experienced previously.  Plus, I think I got some kind of food poisining.  Very disappointing experience.
7777	71	3.0	1	2014-04-06	Eight of us sat outside on a chilly day (note, there's no heat lamps!).  Their genmaicha tea was pretty good (I liked how it came with a lid so it stayed hot longer!). I had the khao soi and sizzling sisig.  Both were pretty unique in taste and looked nice, but taste wise, I'd say both dishes were just ok.  They also say everything's family style, but we all just got our own dishes haha, which really was enough for each person!
13694	71	4.0	1	2014-04-02	P&K offered a casual, laid back atmosphere with delicious food and an attentive and friendly staff. The Grilled Pork Jowl with brussel sprouts, Cod in banana leaf, BBQ Baby back ribs, Sizzling Sissig, and both rices (coconut & Jasmine) were definitely our favorites.  I was with a group and we ordered and shared almost the entire menu.   The portions were on the smaller side, but so were the prices. We did have to wait about fifteen minutes after our reserved time, but that is expected of a place in high demand.  The staff was quick to recognize the inconvenience and offer a free round of drinks. I really enjoyed the experience and look to revisit Pig and Khao in the near future.
13695	71	1.0	1	2014-04-02	"If you dont want to pay for a pricey but small servings of food, bad service and ""pretending to be filipino"" asian restaurant, do not go here! I really don't get it why people raved about this place. I am a Filipino, so i thought of going to a place listed under filipino restaurants in yelp! They have good reviews especially for the sisig. So i thought it is worth a try. Well, let me go to the service first. It sucks! I came there tired because the place is not ""very obvious"" from outside and i had to walk back Clinton st after i called them. When I got inside at 6:20, i said i'm early for a 7pm appointment with 3 more people and i'll just get a drink. The waiter, gave me a menu and seated me in a table for two and said, ""just stay here but since you don't have a reservation, you might need to move when customers come in who have their reservations!"" And i said sarcastically, ""i'll just have my drink in the waiting area then!"" So i went there. He noticed how disappointed I was, and asked me to move back to the table! Crazy huh?! Verrrrry bad service! My fault was, i should have left At that moment! Now comes the food! What's the rave with the sisig?! It's not even close to authentic Filipino sisig! Except for it is served the same way (in a sizzling plate) with egg! And for $15 bucks? It is OVERPRICED! The crispy pata is also pricey for 25! It says big plate, but it was served in a small plate! Plus the taste is not ""filipino!"" Somebody has to tell them that CRIspy pata is not at all SWEET! It is salty! But theirs is very sweet, like i'm eating a Chinese fried pork! There were four of us and we have not finished those I ordered! I feel bad that we had to go our way for a crappy, pricey food and rude servers! Also, another thing about the service! Servers kept on coming to our table to ask if we are done even if they see that there are still a lot in our table! Obviously they wanted us to go to accommodate other customers in the verrry small place! I ordered halo halo and they went several times to get it even if i'm not done! Until i just said, go get it! Somebody has to tell the servers that the ice shaved as it melted with the ice cream is the one that we pay for! And not only the toppings! My glass was still full and just because they can hardly see a topping on it, does not mean i'm done!! All in all, twas a bad experience! Got ripped off! Twas a very bad dining night!"
13696	71	4.0	1	2014-04-01	The food is really good, but I've been twice and I feel like I don't need to go back. It's a fun, interesting menu, but a lot of the dishes appear to be versions of the same. Really great service, though, and it's so well-located - if you're in the LES, I'd stop by.
13697	71	5.0	1	2014-03-30	I love this place, such a great local hang out.  I fell in love with the pork belly.  Will be coming back for that and as well as the mussels.  The lemongrass broth was so yummy!
13698	71	4.0	1	2014-03-27	We went here for our friends get together and the food was really delicious. The place is small and cozy, and it has an open kitchen which is nice. The coconut rice was amazing, the vegetables and the papaya salad. The pork belly was little greasy and the ribs were delicious! I would definetly come here again!
13699	71	4.0	1	2014-03-26	By the time you finish your meal, there will be an entire pig-version of Mr. Potato Head in your tummy.
13700	71	5.0	1	2014-03-25	The food here is intensely flavorful!! Seriously wow!! We had a table of 5 and shared all small plates. All super good! My personal fav was the pork belly adobo w/egg. The curry noodles were awesome. The pig jowl was delicious. It was my first time trying pig jowl. I thought it would be a hunk of jaw staring at me on the plate - thankfully I was wrong. Just yummy hunks of meat. The salads were good also we tried both the Chinese sausage salad and the chicken/green mango. Yum! The coconut rice is delicious and the maltao buns (spelling?) yum! Overall no complaints! We arrived late for our reservation and they were super nice about it and were helpful throughout the meal. The place is popular and busy so it is high energy. It's not a quiet calm environment. If you are looking for outstanding food that is out of the norm I say it's your deal! Oh and it's casual! Nice to have good food without having to get dressed to the nines in a stiff environment.
13701	71	2.0	1	2014-03-25	I've lived across the street from this place for over a year and finally went, with fairly high expectations.  We went on a Monday so it wasn't too busy, service was so so, nothing to write home about. My date and I shared three small plates, of which only one I really liked.  However, The gin and grapefruit cocktail was delicious. The place seemed kind of dirty and low rent for a place that had such a good reputation.  We had a fruit fly buzzing around us all night. Overall, I've had better Filipino fusion food just a few blocks away.
13702	71	4.0	1	2014-03-22	Pig and Khao fits right in with the recent trend of trendy ethnic-influenced restaurants sprouting up in New York. Like many other Lower East Side establishments, the space is cozy, the diners are young, and the flavors are bold. The food is served family style, which is perfect for sampling the different Filipino-influenced dishes Pig and Khao serves up.  It's not perfect but the food is interesting enough that it's worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood. As the name suggests, the menu is very meat heavy, although there are a few fish and seafood dishes available (none in our party ordered these but maybe next time!). I would think twice about coming if you're vegetarian, unless you're happy with just vegetable sides and rice. Speaking of the rice, make sure to order the coconut rice. The slightly sweet and creamy rice will go well with the savory meat-based dishes. Jasmine rice is another option, but at the same price coconut is the winner. Of course, now for the entrees... they're divided into small and large plates. (Think of small as something on the larger than a tapas portion but smaller than your usual entree). If you like pork, you won't go wrong with the grilled pork jowl and pork belly adobo.  The adobo's poached egg and the thick pieces of crispy pork belly, reminded me of eggs and bacon on steroids... in a good way. We also ordered two of the large plates, the baby back ribs and the short ribs. Maybe it was an off night, but while seasoned and sauced well the baby back ribs were disappointingly overcooked.  However, the short ribs were cooked to melt-in-your-mouth perfection. For some lighter fare, Pig & Khao also offers a mango and Chinese sausage salad. I would go with the mango. The Chinese salad didn't offer enough sausage to please our carnivore-sides and the bibb lettuce and other vegetables weren't interesting enough to make up for it.  The mango salad was was a great combination of sour, sweet, and tangy flavors though. After a meal that rich, dessert wasn't really necessary - but maybe next time!
13703	71	1.0	1	2014-03-21	"I came here tonight so excited with such high expectations and was ready to have a delicious meal. But WOW was I so wrong and I was so let down and insulted by this place. Or rather not the place but the blonde hostess. I came in 15 to 9 pm and asked how long a wait for two would be. I got the answer ""about 15 mins"", which sounded great to me.... Boy was this woman lying straight to my face. As me and my date sat and waited patiently, I noticed another party of two come in and told to sit and wait. 20 mins in (past the supposed 15 min wait) this hostess comes and sits the couple that CAME AFTER US. By this point I was thinking no big deal.. Its totally cool. Min by min passed, I look around and see two damn tables cleared and would you believe it they were set with tableware and everything. Im wondering why isn't she sitting us there but continued to wait. Then guess what! Another couple comes in and they sit for a total of 5 mins, FIVE MINUTES and she comes and sits them before US again! This was already 40 mins into the original ""15 min wait"".  Anger doesn't even describe how I felt, but to put the cherry on top she comes over to me to tell me pathetically the ""the table I have for you well the people haven't left yet, they are chatty"" -_- really you don't say? Cause I had no idea people actually have conversations when they go to dinner. How about you sit me at one of the two EMPTY tables. My money must have not been good enough for this establishment, which is totally alright by me. Wont be returning or recommending to anyone. It was beyond ridiculous. And why she even had the audacity to look at me with shock as I left is beyond me... You wait 40 mins, have others seated before you and then have to stare at two empty tables while no one else is coming in. Thanks for NOTHING."
13704	71	5.0	1	2014-03-20	Awesome time tonight! First off these guys nailed it with some classic 90's hip hop. Definitely set me back to the good ol days. Drinks at this spot are crazy cheap - you can get Genny cream ales in a can for $3 or bottomless PBR's for $15. Either way you can't go wrong. Food was delicious. Reminded me of my travels across Asia. I had the pork jowl with Brussel sprouts and the mussels. Both of them were exploding with taste and spice. All in all the meal was super cheap and the decor/environment was kick ass. My new favorite neighborhood spot!
13705	71	3.0	1	2014-03-19	The sizzling sisig is a must try here, I liked it a lot better than the sisig at Maharlika. Would definitely come back just for this dish. The pork jowl was alright, tasted like the chef got a little lemon-happy it was too citrusy/sour but the brussel sprouts were grilled to perfection. Overall, it was an ok experience. They have an open section so you can see the chefs at work but I almost wish it was hidden because they were not very professional looking, I don't see the point of having an open kitchen here.
13706	71	4.0	1	2014-03-18	"I've been feeling empty for the past couple days. This emptiness has consumed my life, my time, and most importantly, my happiness. It's hard for me to articulate just how bad things have gotten since the mysterious disappearance of Flight 370 of Malaysia Airlines. Where did it go? Why did it go? Where can it be? Is there no god? Enter Pig and Khao. I was lucky enough to frequent this establishment with a Yelp eliter. Due to her extensive experience at Yelp-reviewing eateries across the nation, I was assured that her recommendation would be quite a fine one. Fine enough to get past the enigmatic loss of Flight 370 of Malaysia Airlines? I was about to find out. I made my way towards Pig and Khao at about 6:30pm on a weekday. I was quickly seated by our waiter who was more than attentive. He was informative, on-point, and helpful- much unlike the Malaysian authorities investigating flight 370 of Malaysia Airlines. He offered us a drink menu to which I quickly perused. I ordered a rye cocktail which tasted like whiskey with a minuscule hint of sugar. Fortunately, I have a deep inclination toward strong drinks, but I could see how this could be off putting to those with a more delicate palate. My Yelp companion had the ""FTP"" which was sweet, strong, but not overwhelming. The drinks were on point and I was satisfied but still, I could not stop thinking about the Boeing 777 which whereabouts are still yet to be known. With modern technology the way it is, how is it possible to lose a plane as massive as that of Flight 370? I sipped on my drink and sighed. Those poor souls. We then proceeded to order the food of the Filipino people. I had only had Filipino cuisine once in my life, and that was years ago when I was a teenager. How I envy my former self, who didn't have to be burdened by the loss of Flight 370. Worriless and carefree. Unaware of the future events of March 8, 2014. We ordered the sisig and a pork belly dish with a side of jasmine rice. The sisig was incredible. Crunchy in that delectable fried pork way that can only be accompanied by too many calories. WIth a strong sense of lime, coriander, and certain spice that I cannot name due to my limited knowledge of Southeast spices- I was surprised by how tasty the dish was. As surprising as the loss of flight 370? Give the restaurant a try. That is for you to decide. The pork belly dish was mostly fat. Hey, I enjoy eating animal fat as much as the next guy, but this was a little bit too much. I am fully aware that slices of pork belly are usually very fatty, but the slices of meat we received was just lard. I still have yet to forget about the missing plane. I feel as if my soul will never be at peace until we know exactly what happened to that flight. I wait with bated breath; asking questions; looking for answers."
13707	71	3.0	1	2014-03-18	"I'm relatively new to Filipino cuisine and really wanted to love this place because of all the raving reviews. My other Filipino dining experience was with Maharlika in East Village, which was very pleasant and delicious.  Pig and Khao just didn't quite cut it. We started out with drinks, which were strong and therefore fantastic! The Lower East Side is a whiskey drink with a good deal of whiskey in it. I'm not a huge fan of overwhelmingly strong drinks, but my friend loved it (alcoholic!). I really liked the ""FTP"" (f-ck the...police/pig?) because it was a strong tasty drink without having an overwhelming alcoholic taste. For the entrees, skip the pork belly adobo and get the sizzling sisig. The sizzling sisig lives up to the hype, but the pork belly was really disappointing. The soft poached egg was a good touch to the pork belly, as was the egg in the sizzling sisig dish. The sizzling sisig was really flavorful and had a mix of pork fat, pork chunks, and what looked and tasted like pig ear. The pork belly was too fatty and only one of the 3 slices had meat on it! Why did I just pay $14 for candle lard?!! I probably wouldn't come back again to order the pork belly, but I'd be intrigued to try some of the other dishes on the menu if I'm in the area and craving Filipino food."
13708	71	4.0	1	2014-03-17	The place is cozy. It's open during specific hours, so plan accordingly. There's one single-occupancy bathroom. Sisig -- do it. This is what comfort food is really about. It's not a complex dish, but it's well executed. They bring it to you on a hot cast iron pan and you mix the egg into the meat. Only wish there were two eggs. Would go well with rice if you're into that kinda stuff. Pork jowl -- it's zesty/tangy, where I prefer salty. This dish was mostly grilled veggies, and I wouldn't get it again. Not that it was bad -- the menu was just not descriptive enough about it. Interesting flavor for sure. Mantao -- they're fried, which is unusual. I'm used to eating them plain, and I wanted them plain. There's salt or sugar or something on them, too. The crispy outside and fluffy inside made this typically chinese-style bun into a western bread. Still prefer them plain, but I ate and enjoyed all of them.
13709	71	5.0	1	2014-03-11	I've been here a number of times and the food has always been great. This place ideal for medium to small parties and the menu is designed to be shared. Sisig, Grilled Pork Jowl, Khao Soi and the Baby Back Ribs are perennial faves and always sooooo good. They're also great reminders that meat means more than just a piece of steak.   Most other items on the menu rotate seasonally.  Coconut rice is a must, but the side vegetables are felt more like an afterthought. We got Choy Sum to satisfy our daily servings of vegetables and that's pretty much all it did.  No special seasonings or prep. Drinks were good, but I wouldn't got out of my way for any one drink in particular.  Be sure to make a reservation!
13710	71	4.0	1	2014-03-10	Very affordable for the area. The pig head and shaved ice were really flavorful, and the pig head was something that is relatively uncommon outside a traditional Chinese restaurant. The staff, however, is probably high.... and not on life. They're pretty absent minded, rigid about where we can be seated even when nobody else is around, and just not a lot of attention to detail. It goes with the territory though (Village), and nothing was really a big deal impact to our experience. Just not polished, which is fine, especially at the fair prices. The bathroom was clean and the food was good. That's what's important!
13711	71	5.0	1	2014-03-09	A way to tell if you truly enjoy a place is when you actually go there and plan to go there more than once. Pig and Khao is one of those places where I actually go more than once or even twice! And everyone knows when you have in an egg in the majority of dishes, it's gonna work. Thank you pig and khao for giving me a delicious fill of pork and egg and everything else. I will be back!
13712	71	4.0	1	2014-03-09	I brought some out of town visitors after the recommendation of another friend from out of town who LOVES FOOD. It was a HIT! We had so much pork, though, it's hard not to feel guilty. We shared the sisig, adobo, dorade, and coconut rice. We had hoped to order the short rib, but it wasn't available so we ordered the pata instead. Everything was delicious, flavored really well. The sauce for the dorade was light and very pleasing. We also shared the turon which was perfectly paired with salted caramel ice cream and the halo halo which wasn't the greatest in my opinion. I've had great halohalo, from the Philippines, to New York to California, and I found this halo halo was way too milky. Service was great -the staff was really sweet.  Great experience overall and will be back with other friends.
13713	71	5.0	1	2014-03-07	Creative and delicious food. Good atmosphere, helpful service.
5613	71	4.0	1	2014-03-05	"If there is one dish you get here - let it be the sizzling sisig. It's absolutely glorious. It's no secret that Filipinos know how to work a pig. This dish takes it a step further by giving you the parts of a pig's head. It's a delicious mix of fatty, meaty & crunchy parts. Make sure to squeeze all the lime juice in cuz it adds balance and freshness to the dish - and what a beautiful, juicy slice of lime it is. I don't usually get this excited about lime but this was quite exquisite. The dish comes with a raw egg in the center for you to mix in with the piggy parts. Actually it's already half cooked by the time it arrives because the dish is very hot. There is also just the right amount of cilantro to garnish.  (5/5) I loved the green rice crusted dorade as well - crunchy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside. It came in a yuzu dashi which also had cockles (salt water clams) and many hidden pieces of chinese sausage. I felt like I was in a treasure hunt when looking for these delicious morsels in the sauce. They had run out of bok choy, which is the usual vegetable to accompany this dish so they used choy sum instead - which i actually prefer.  (4/5) The last dish we had here was the khao soi. This dish was the reason I came here. I've been looking for good khao soi in NY for the last 15 years but I haven't found it yet. Unfortunately it looks like that search is going to continue. To be fair, this is a Thai dish so I wasn't sure what this was doing on the menu in the first place but the name is Pig & Khao, so......   Anyways, the noodles weren't bad but the curry was another story. It tasted nothing like a good red curry should. I  liked the heat level but the curry tasted too much like curry powder. (3/5) I also highly recommend getting a coconut rice to go with your dishes. It really complements the flavors in all the dishes. These were 3 ""small dishes""  (they had recommended 2 small and 1 large for the two of us) but that was good enough for us as we weren't too hungry and had kinda just walked in on a whim. They didn't have a table available and the wait was 15 minutes so we sat at the counter. BIG MISTAKE. Our clothes have been smelling like a bbq pit for days. They are still hanging in the bathroom and being febrezed every day."
13714	71	1.0	1	2014-03-04	Food smelled great, sat down and was slightly annoyed at the offensive rap music playing, but figured it would change... It didn't... I asked for them to change the music, because offensive rap actively agitates me... They said that's how the owner rolls, so they can't change the music.  Asked for the food to go, they said they don't do food to go.  I walked out.  If you love rap music, this place may be great... but if you don't like rap, I suggest avoiding the place.
13715	71	5.0	1	2014-03-02	Because of places like Pig and Khao and my recent trip to Southeast Asia, I'm now obsessed with Filipino food.  WHERE HAS ALL THIS FLAVOR EXPLOSION BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?! I went with about 12 coworkers for dinner (obviously make reservations people, this place gets crowded) which was awesome because we pretty much got 2 of everything on the menu. Here are some things that still keep me drooling at the thought almost a month later: - Sizzling Sisig: honestly, we eat really gross stuff in America so just forget for a second that you're eating pork head here and you'll be fine all you unadventurous people - Mussels: even this has a flavorful Thai kick - Mantao Buns: I know it's just fried dough but it's SO GOOD. Even at the end of dinner where I was too full to even try the Baby Back Ribs, I kept eating these Mantao Buns. - Lamb Neck: how can you go wrong with lamb? - Coconut Rice: so sweet and flavorful - Cod in Banana Leaf: almost anything that comes in a banana leaf is excellent. Fact.   I can't wait to come back and pig (and khao) out again. Sorry I just had to.
13716	71	5.0	1	2014-03-01	Had a fantastic meal here. Loved the vibe if the restaurant from the music to the open kitchen. We were here for brunch. Ordered the sizzling sisig and the bahn xio. The sisig was really good - mixed the egg in and it had a fantastic spice and flavor combination. The bahn xio with the Bibb lettuce was also excellent with the shrimp cooked perfectly. Liked the vinegar on the side. The highlight of the meal however was the incredible garlic fried rice. It was fantastic - the rice was perfectly crispy and garlicky. Looking forward to going back.
13717	71	5.0	1	2014-02-23	Great Sizzling Sissig and Coconut rice!!! Make reservations or arrive at 5pm when they open to be seated at the chef's counter (which I actually enjoy) because the place is small.
13718	71	4.0	1	2014-02-19	Wow, the pork jowl with brussel sprouts is LIFE CHANGING. Definitely have it. Loved the coconut rice and the crispy pata too. The dorade was interesting looking, liked the clams served with it.
13719	71	4.0	1	2014-02-16	Really liked this place for both food, drink and atmosphere.  Has the trendy sharing plates, literally the same menu set up as Chez Sardine, but happily the portions are dead on and all the food we tried was super good.   Like if Latin American & Korean food had a baby.  Delicious sauces, tender, perfectly cooked meat, just overall YUM. Reading reviews, we didn't even order the most popular dishes so will def. go back.  Did the banana leaf wrapped cod, pork belly, and ribs - oh my god. All of them, I wanted to lick the plates.  The rice was great for soaking up the rest of the sauce.  Price is right too - 'bout $115 for 1 snack, 2 smalls, 1 large and drinks for 2 - since you don't need to order a ton.   Super small spot, but lively with the kitchen on display, and they played late 90s/early '00 rap/ hip hop the whole time. Awesome.  Only negative is that our server, while attentive, seemed a bit frazzled and overwhelmed, but everyone else was chill & all friendly & helpful.
13720	71	5.0	1	2014-02-10	This is an excellent restaurant.  The vibe couldn't be more chill, the servers couldn't be friendlier, and the best part is certainly the food, especially the sizzling sisig which is simply a dream.   The family style arrangement is fun, they have nice patio seating on warmer days, and their brunch is also good (try their delicious Vietnamese style coffee!).
13721	71	5.0	1	2014-02-09	So I've read the reviews before I came to investigate! :) Finally made it out there this weekend mid-afternoon... we didn't have any reservation and most of the tables were already reserved for a party, but thankfully there were 2 seats open right by the bar... managed to squeeze in! Man those stools were tall!!! haha especially to someone as vertically challenged as I am! It was a struggle! Anyway... my friend and I ordered the sausage and of course, the sizzling sisig! I've been dying to try some good sisig for the longest time! The last time I tried some (at PAYAG - in Queens) I was GREATLY disappointed and disgusted - it smelled wrong and undercooked! I couldn't eat it! Ok so back to Pig and Khao: So our orders came, and for some reason we thought the sausage was gonna be a bigger meal than it actually was - it turned out to be more of an appetizer! They gave us 2 links. The sisig was definitely of decent proportion! it did not disappoint!!! It was DELICIOUS! it hit the spot, for sure! I had a pleasant experience --- thanks to the Pig and Khao's staff!!! Really nice guys!!! I'm definitely coming back!
13722	71	4.0	1	2014-02-09	Came here with my fiancé and two other friends. We ordered the fried oysters, roasted peanuts, chicharron, crispy pata, cod fish in banana leaf, mussels, green mango salad, pork belly adobo.   Food was  good - amongst our favorite was the roasted peanuts (great with beer, wish I could take home a whole bag), pork belly adobo, and mussels. The rest were still very good but not stellar.   As expected with a restaurant that has self-serve bottomless beer, the ambience was fun and casual.  Unfortunately, their service wasn't very consistent.   The food came in spurts. Our mussels were served at the very end of our meal as if they forgot.  Also, when we tried to order dessert they abruptly told us they didn't have any (granted we were they very late but it still left a bad impression with me). Overall, it was a good time but I don't feel the need to come back again.
7784	71	4.0	1	2014-02-07	A great find! I really like filipino food. Our group of 5 came in on a Sunday for lunch. The space is small-ish but they do a good job or organizing the space so that they can actually accommodate larger groups. I'm a fan of the open kitchen - it's fun to watch the chefs craft their dishes!   We ordered a variety of dishes to share, family style, along with a couple orders of garlic fried rice. - longonissa sausage: I love these little, sweet, savory sausages - sizzling sisig: pork head, but chopped up so it's not recongnizable - pork jowl: super yummy! - champorado: This was a completely random, but  tasty dish. A chocolate rice pudding with bits of salty, crispy bacon mixed in. Surprisingly tasty! Everything was delicious and semi-reasonably priced. If only the dishes were a little larger (or even just came with rice) . . this place would be a 5 star.
13723	71	4.0	1	2014-02-07	We had a corporate event here.  Since the restaurant is quite small, we rented out the whole space for dinner.  In terms of food, I would give a solid four stars - we tried nearly everything on the menu (family style) and I was quite satisfied with almost every item.  The fish was the weakest dish and the brussel sprouts the strongest.  The fish cake appetizers were very good as well.  In terms of service, I would give five stars - the staff was very attentive and friendly.  Cannot ask for more in that regard.  The space is also a great spot for small corporate events.  The open kitchen allows guests to experience the cooking as they are eating.  The biggest let down, however, was that Leah Cohen was not very hospitable.  Several of us were excited to meet her (as we are Top Chef fans), but she made it clear that she did not appreciate people asking her to take pictures with them.  This is despite the fact that our group tried to be sensitive that she was working in the kitchen by having just a handful of group pictures with her towards the beginning of the night.  She did not greet us or come across as friendly or interested in leaving a good impression.  Not what you would expect at a corporate event, especially given that we had reserved the entire restaurant for the night.  But other than that, the food, space and service were great!
13724	71	4.0	1	2014-02-01	The food is super tasty and vibe is trendy casual. Everything is really flavorful - I liked that their crispy pata was de-boned. The food was definitely a 5, but had to knock a star for the service. We felt that we were rushed as they constantly kept asking if we were done with our dishes when we clearly were not. The cilantro soda was also really refreshing and delish.
13725	71	5.0	1	2014-01-30	Fantastic. Everything was delicious and well worth the wait. To start - there isn't a sign outside, so it was a bit hard to find in an area of the LES that doesn't brag much in terms of bars or restaurants for that matter. So to wait, there weren't many choices as to where to linger at as Pig & Khao itself was so busy - there wasn't room for overflow inside. After a longer than anticipated wait, I ordered the Khao Soi - which is spicy and rich - and the coconut rice. The noodles were chewy, chicken was cooked perfectly. Now, the coconut rice was completely unnecessary for me to order as this was a noodle dish, but I was so glad I did as it soaked in the curry sauce - the rice was to die for. Our waiter was attentive and helpful - his recommendation was for everything family style - but sometimes I have a problem with that as people have different dietary restrictions... so I opted out of that. My only complaint would be that the beers come in cans. I always prefer a draft over a can. But we switched to wine and everything was fine. My only other complaint would be the noise level. It was very loud and very cramped. But I guess again, that's par for the course at a popular restaurant in Manhattan, so not sure they lose a star for that.
5417	71	5.0	1	2014-01-30	I've been here a few times now and the food is consistently fantastic. Try the lamb curry - It's fatty but will blow your mind. The sissig is also incredible.  My only complaint is that the wait is pretty long, even with a reservation. However the staff are really nice and the food more than makes up for the inconvenience.
13726	71	4.0	1	2014-01-29	Meal was yummy, but I honestly don't remember much after eating all the Halo-Halo dessert that I should have shared!  That is worth returning for, however, I do suggest skipping the Chicharron, you can pick up a bag of these in any bodega.  Great vibes and tunes.
13727	71	5.0	1	2014-01-29	WOW doesn't begin to describe my experience here. All of our food was fantastic, service was un intrusive but timely. Atmosphere was fun and crowded and cool. If I were to go back I would definitely consider the pre fix menu. $39 for 5 courses I think?!? Amazing We had Sizzling Sisig, Jasmine Rice, Pork Rinds with Coconut Vinegar, Pork Belly Adobo and  Coconut Curry Cod on a Banana Leaf. So So So Yum! With my perfect Coffee
13728	71	4.0	1	2014-01-28	If you love pork, this is the spot for you! If you don't, stay away. The food is incredibly rich and flavorful and the small restaurant is cozy and pleasantly loud. Drinks were nothing to write home about but with all the delicious food, we didn't even think about what we were drinking. We ordered the pork jowl, pork belly, sizzling sisig (pork head), and the crispy pata (pork leg). Like I said, this place is for pork lovers. The pork jowl was hands down the winner. It was velvety and salty, perfectly complimented by crispy Brussels sprouts. The pork head (diced, not served whole) and pork belly came in second and the pork leg was good, but clearly overshadowed by the other dishes. Remember to get the coconut rice since the sweetness goes nicely with the salty dishes. All the fat in these dishes sticks to your bones, perfect for this freezing New York winter!
13729	71	5.0	1	2014-01-27	The food was great and the beer was reasonably priced. We did the small dishes (medium sized) for sharing and felt full up after 3 dishes and a bowl of rice. It wasn't too busy when we went (7ish on sunday), but it was probably early for the east village crowd. Not cheap, but I think it's worth it.
13730	71	5.0	1	2014-01-27	"We were looking for something different to do for dinner and a different locale on this biz trip, so we decided on the LES.  Hadn't been down there in a while.  It's not easy to get down there from the UWS if you're trying to avoid taking a cab.  Lots of obscure lettered trains (take the 3 to 14th, walk over to the F, etc., etc.) and switching, walking through tunnels and trains stopping for all kinds of crazy reasons.  All of which happened to me on Thursday night.  In the end for me? That made it all the more cool. I ventured from the Delancey Street station into the 10 degree night over to Clinton Street.  I was struck by how much the area reminded me of Alphabet City a very long time ago.  Industrial storefronts mixed with small, high-end fashion storefronts and cool up and coming restaurants.  I actually walked right by Pig & Khao due to my interest in all the other interesting things going on around me.  It's a small place. I hiked it back to the restaurant and was greeted by a gorgeous hostess who was graciously understanding about my tardiness and offered me a drink while I waited for my date.  I ordered an ""FTP"" appleton vx, cognac, peach, cinnamon bark....so good I proceeded to have more than I could count. Once seated, we chose the chef's five course tasting menu.  I was a little resistant because I was sure I wanted to have the Grilled Pork Jowl dish and wasn't sure we'd get it.  Our waiter assured us we'd get it. Amuse bouche: ....kind of a fried shrimp with a salsa and creamy, spicy sauce which definitely amused my bouche. Fried Blue Point Oysters with a garlic, ginger, chilies and lime- juice dipping sauce. I like oysters, but when I saw fried oysters, I was a little hesitant.  Once I put one in mouth, I instantly changed my mind.  The combination of the texture and the dipping sauce was sensational. Grilled Pork Jowl brussel sprouts, toasted rice, lime-chili, fish sauce, herbs. The pork was tender and flavorful and the brussel sprouts were more shaved than sprouts and they were cooked just the way I liked them...slightly sautéed/burned.  The whole dish had a citrus finish. Coconut Rice: Can't say enough about the coconut rice.  Never had it before....Now if I'm going to eat white rice at home (and I don't do that often), I'm going to find out how to make it.  It has to be the best white rice I've ever eaten. BBQ Chicken: The chicken was tender and hot and the barbecue sauce was tangy and spicy.  It wasn't your typical BBQ chicken.  Can't put my finger on it, so to speak, but it definitely had a Filipino flair to it. Khao Soi: Red curry, coconut milk, chicken, egg noodles, pickled mustard greens, shallots.  I almost wish they'd served this first.  I love soup and I love noodles.  By the time this arrived, my little stomach was nearly full. Even though this is family style and we shared everything, the plates were ample...we were at our limit.  The curry was out of this world.  The soup was rich and thick, the noodles were flavorful...it was one of the highlights. Turon: banana fritter, salted caramel ice cream, chocolate sauce. So freakin good.  The ice cream really was salted...perfect amount of salt to complement the sweetness of the fritters. In addition to the menu, the classy staff and the overall feel of the restaurant, they played a cool rotation of music that just topped off the package.  One of my new faves in NYC."
13731	71	5.0	1	2014-01-26	Very tasty, fun and casual place. Went for brunch and sat at the bar - do this if you can! You get to see each dish as it comes out and they all look delicious. We ordered the Khao soi and sizzling sisig. The dishes are so flavorful that I recommend splitting various ones, so you don't get sick of it. Order the side of garlic rice!
12474	71	4.0	1	2014-01-26	While waiting for our clothes to get tailored at a neighboring joint, my husband and I popped into Pig & Khao.  Sat at the bar area in front of the kitchen because we didn't have a reservation, which ended up being pretty awesome since we could see all the action.  Everything they were preparing smelled sooo good, we were very excited to try the food.  Ordered the sizzling sisig--diced up pig head with a raw egg on top.  Liked that some pieces were crunchy and others were softer.   This was very good with some garlic rice.  The tom yum soup was also pretty good.  Wasn't really that spicy if you're looking for that though.  If we return, will need to try the khao soi.  Super friendly people working here.
13732	71	5.0	1	2014-01-23	Ate here the other night for the 3rd time and it was even more amazing than ever - we had 9 different dishes on the menu and all our table could talk about was which was the best dish because one was just as delicious as the next. I highly recommend eating here, particularly if you enjoy exciting and flavorful food, and trying lots of the small plates as well as the desert with shaved ice - I'm still thinking about the chicken wings on special the other night, Wow.
13733	71	3.0	1	2014-01-21	Overall experience rating is a 2.5 but I gave it a 3 because I love the Sizzling Sisig. Call or swing by the restaurant even if OpenTable says there are no spots.  I got a table for 6 people by just appearing at the restaurant.  It gets busy during the latter half of the evening.  The atmosphere is pretty cool and service is friendly. Enjoy!
13734	71	2.0	1	2014-01-14	I'm new to Filipino food, but I've already begun to search for the next best spot and for me, Pig and Khao isn't it. The restaurant is nice, the staff is sweet, but the food for the price just isn't worth it. We sat at the bar because we didn't have a reservation and there weren't any open tables. This turned out to be a good move because we had a lot of space, more than usual at a bar seat, and we had the extra entertainment of being right in front of the kitchen. For food, I had the pork belly adobo ($13) and my friend had the khao soi ($16), we both had the coconut rice ($3 each). Everything came out really fast but the portions for some things were crazy small! The khao soi was a good amount of food and paired well with the coconut rice, which was delicious. The pork belly however, was really good but there were only 4 slices. Four. Slices. of Pork. Belly. I'm sure your doctor would be happy about that, but I think $13 should earn you a little more than that. Everything else was fine; our waters never got down to the bottom because the staff was incredibly attentive in a non-annoying way. I wish I could give them a better rating, but the food/price just doesn't do it for me. Sorry, guys!
13735	71	3.0	1	2014-01-13	So I went to Pig and Khao tonight, again, and brought my cousin and his girlfriend who are both chefs in New England.  I love the food there!  Still do despite the ridiculous experience that we had with the chef tonight.  My cousin and his girl have been here for 3 days now and I have taken them to a multitude of places.  At the end of dinner my cousin expressed that he was most impressed with the food at Pig and Khao and he would love to say thanks to the chef and just ask some questions about her inspiration with the food.  Her staff was great, one of the gentleman is actually from the same area that my cousin is from so the energy was there. Chef Leah had been there all night looking after the kitchen staff. Not to mention it's a Monday night and the restaurant was not really busy at all.  I told my cousin just ask the server to have her come over, she is right there.  You could tell the waiter was apprehensive.  I watched, with my own eyes, the server told her we would like her to come over, she glanced at the table, took a sip of her drink and rolled her eyes.  She walked by our table two times, going to the front bar making small talk with the new bartender, who was great, and then walking back to the kitchen, about 5 minutes had passed by then poof she disappears.  The bill comes, $249.00 spent between 4 people.  A great dinner, again I have no qualms with the food but Chef Leah, no hospitality what so ever, even on a Monday night.  She is the prime example of why I am fed up with the food industry in NY.  Attitude and lack of hospitality. I really would have loved to have Chef Leah do a Master Chef class at my culinary center.  Granted, I am no ICE but even still, I would have loved to bring attention to her food and passion to people who do not travel far out of their comfort zone but because we were not a food critic for NY Times or someone who she deemed important, she passed us on by.  I have welcomed pig and khao to NYC with open arms and defended the restaurant when others claimed that in this sea of culinary adventure, otherwise known as NYC, that this restaurant  wasn't that good at all but now.... I will never go there again. It is not worth my time or my money. What makes me laugh about it all is finding this video of a very phony experience that Chef Leah claims to offer.  Instead of blaming her restaurant group for her failure, maybe she should study hospitality, a virtue that doesn't seem to come naturally to her. It seems that this might be the true struggle with her restaurant.  tmz.com/2013/09/19/top-c…
13736	71	5.0	1	2014-01-07	Pig and Khao? More like friggin wow! Okay I cringed a little, but I promise the food is much better than my terrible word play. You walk in, and the aroma of flavorful meats and spices immediately assaults you.  You sit, and excitedly look at the menu wanting to order everything.  Upon realizing that the entire menu is a little too big for three people, you decide to be conservative and only order half the menu. Next time I go, I'm ordering the other half.   We decided on ordering most of the small plates with the market vegetable and coconut rice.  The sizzling sisig met the hype, but everything else was delicious too.  The mussel sauce, the khao soi, pork belly, etc. were all incredibly flavorful and rich.  We used the fried mantaos that came with the mussel sauce to soak up every last bit of the khao soi broth. The place itself is very cozy, and being in the LES, somewhat trendy though we did see families there too.  Service was excellent, with our water always being refilled. All in all, holy cow was it good! (Sorry couldn't resist...)
13737	71	2.0	1	2014-01-06	I loved their rum and coconut juice drink, very fresh and tasty. Their coconut rice was also so unbelievably good, like we couldn't stop exclaiming over it, could almost eat it by itself good. I devoured my bowl, didn't even care that there weren't many entrees to go around. I found the portions REALLY small for the price, especially for the pork belly! I also wasn't crazy about the noodles in peanut/curry sauce. The server was a little pushy and kept questioning our order. It's nice to give feedback, but at some point it gets rude and aggressive. I also miss the taste of traditional Filipino food, so I don't think I would go back.
13738	71	4.0	1	2014-01-03	We braved the impending elements and went to try their tasty-ness! Totally worth it! Although my friend and I wanted to try some things on the menu other yelpers raved about, we ended up going with their My 5 course tasting ($39) and it was def the best choice. We mentioned we wanted to try the pig jowl and they accommodated it as one of the courses! The 5 course tasting includes items that are on the menu as well as chef specials. We has the following: - amuse bouche - shrimp tempura bite (yum!) - fried oysters - if u like oysters, these are fab - pig jowl with brussel sprouts - loved it! Crispy sprouts with fatty jowl... Great contrast of texture - sirloin with a spicy sauce (not sure what it's called) this was our least fav but it was cooked well and came with cabbage leaves to wrap it in. It just felt like it needed a something more... Maybe more acid? - koh soi - I've never had this before so nothing to compare it to but it was so good! Spicy curry like with noddles and chicken.. Everything came with a large bowl of coconut rice - dessert was halo halo - oh man... Soooooo tasty!! We were so full by the end, I wish I had more room in my tummy for it! Overall -would recommend it highly!
13739	71	4.0	1	2014-01-03	Had my birthday here. Loved the backyard in the summer. friendly and helpful staff. Fun to try many new and different dishes and tasty cocktails
13740	71	5.0	1	2014-01-02	Yum. Yum. Yum. Everything. This place has such exciting, happy flavors. Sizzling sisig and coconut rice - just as phenomenal as promised my Yelpers. Also had the lamb which was incredibly flavorful. Portions are pretty big and our waiter had us order more than we needed - but that meant I had leftovers that I was sooooo happy about the next day. This place is a definitely must-try!
13741	71	5.0	1	2014-01-01	wow wow wow wow.  that is only thing to lead with for this spot. Leah Cohen (former top chef contender) opened this place up maybe 2 years or so ago, and I have probably been here 7 or 8 times now.   The food is out of this world good - MUST haves include pork belly adobo, sizzling sisig, KHAO SOI, and another KHAO SOI, (definitely get a couple coconut rices to add on top) atmosphere is cool, chill, hip - music is interesting...kinda some hard core gangsta rap, but goes with the ambiance pretty well actually.  the kitchen is open, so you see everything being made right in front of you - Leah Cohen is there most nights from what I can tell. cocktails are tasty, a decent bottled beer selection, and for $15 you can do bottomless PRB from a cooler run keg tapped in the back - kinda hipster and cool, but w/e. one of my absolute favorite spots in NYC, being in the LES its a bit of a trek, but totally worth it!  they started doing brunch recently, so very excited to try that!!! YUM!
13742	71	3.0	1	2014-01-01	For the record I was born in Manila and grew up with family members who cook Filipino food very, very well, so maybe I'm a bit of a stickler. Came here after a friend recommended this place over Jeepney. Had the pork belly and sirloin, and I was pleased with both. My friend and I both ordered jasmine rice to accompany the entrees. The rice was dry and not very well-made. Not sure how they messed up boiled white rice, but they did. This was at dinner on a Saturday night, by the way. Also it was $3 for one order of that terrible rice. This was the third Filipino/Thai/fusion place I've tried. Maharlika and Jeepney both exceeded my expectations (and I've visited both several times), while Pig and Khao... well, see above.
13743	71	1.0	1	2013-12-31	"I've never written a review here but my experience here provoked me to write one.  Let me start with the service. I made a reservation thru open table for 3 persons at 8:15pm. We got to the restaurant at 8:10pm and the receptionist told us that our table is 'not quite ready' yet. So we sat in the waiting area while seeing 3 vacant tables. We waited for 20 minutes and repeatedly asked the receptionist if she can give us a table already. She finally gave us a table. We ordered Sisig, Crispy Pata, Mussels, Halo-halo and Vietnamese coffee. I was born and raised in the Philippines so I know how Filipino food should taste like. It is understandable that the food was going to be fusionized and altered in order to cater to customers that have never tried authentic Filipino/Thai food. The Sisig is the better one among everything else. But it was missing a lot of ingredients and was full of fats instead of pig organs. The Crispy Pata, that did not taste like Crispy Pata, came when we were almost done with the meal. The Mussels were okay because it had coconut spiced sauce. Then, the Halo-halo came. Since people here in yelp said that it was really good, we ordered it to make ourselves feel better about the bad entrees. However, the Halo-halo was like cereal(rice crispies) in milk topped with shaved ice, 10 pieces of coconut strips and old and hard cubes of banana, topped with ube ice cream. Halo-halo means ""mix-mix"". I guess they were mixing crappy disgusting ingredients. And we heard that several suggestions were already addressed by customers in order to improve the quality and the taste of the food. This place is fooling a lot of white people. I'll be surprised if it lasts another year (unless changes are gonna be made)."
7220	71	3.0	1	2013-12-24	"After my trip to Manila as a child, I sometimes need a reminder of what good Filipino food tastes like. Although it's not my favorite cuisine that I crave all the time, I still am willing to go once in a while... besides it's Jon's fave so I can't say no haha. As we drove over to LES and went to look for Pig and Khao... we were pleasantly surprised by how cute this place is. The lighting is dim, and very intimate. The outside area is lit by colorful lights and is a nice little ""back yard"" area which is very cozy, especially when it's warm out. Jon and I always enjoy a good dish of Sisig whenever we can find it... but that was not the best thing that Pig and Khao has to offer. It was a pretty decent dish, but we've tried it at other places where we enjoyed it more. We also had the Crispy Pata/ crispy pork legs and I wasn't a huge fan. I did see Jon polish most of the plate though. I needed to pair it with some coconut rice and a fresh spiked coconut because I like things a little more mild in taste... and who doesn't love a fresh alcoholic coconut beverage? Lastly, our favorite here was definitely the Halo-Halo... which was simply crack. Wow, we've had Halo-Halo at other places... and we've had really good home made Halo-Halo... but this was the best ever. If you're not in the mood for dinner, just come for some Halo-Halo. Overall, our experience here was decent. We found the place online and heard good things about it. It is a little bit on the pricey end, but totally worth it if you're coming for desert!"
13744	71	4.0	1	2013-12-23	Food was quite flavorful. We opted to sit outside since the weather was delightful but inside was the better choice. Started with a smooth drip coffee served with condensed milk.  My boyfriend and I shared the Khao Soi (thanks to previous Yelp reviews) and ordered a side of garlic fried rice and longonissa sausage. I wouldn't recommend the rice since it was nothing special. But I would recommend sharing the Khao Soi! Would I return? Sure, why not. Enjoy.
13745	71	3.0	1	2013-12-22	I was really excited to eat here... not only do they have my all time favorite dish on the menu, Khao Soy, but they have a good beer selection too. I left the restaurant underwhelmed. The vibe was kind of cool... though maybe the music was a little offensive for dinner. The place is clean and the tables are close. We pretty much ate as a party of five, as opposed to it being the 2 of us, but such is dinner in NYC. We started with the sisig, which is sooooo recommended, not only on yelp, but also by the waiter. The first few bites were good, then my mouth was just coated in fat, and I was eating fat, and it was all fat, fat, fat. If you decide to order this dish, I highly recommend ordering it with rice. You totally need a bland carb to cut all of the fat you will be consuming. I don't understand how complimentary rice isn't served with this dish. My husband had the sirloin, and that was pretty darn delicious. Now for the Khao Soy... sigh... I feel like this is a very personal dish. People have the way they like it, and any other variation is going to be ill received. I prefer Khao Soy with a thicker, sweeter broth, a ton of cilantro, lime, and the right amount of crunch. This dish had good heat and good crunch but was missing some richness, or some decadence. I wish it was sweeter, I wish it had more lime/cilantro accompaniments. It didn't cure my Khao Soy craving. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what it should be... for my taste. The fried banana fritters were good too. I'm a banana freak, and I didn't finish the last piece, so... yea. This place is 3 stars... just a-ok.
13746	71	5.0	1	2013-12-22	The food is amazing, drinks are strong, staff is friendly, Leah Cohen is actually at her restaurant. Amazing. As expected, Pig & Khao was very crowded especially for a Friday at 7PM. We had to wait a few minutes for our table to be cleared. In the meantime we got drinks from the bar. [Side note: the waiting area is very small and there is no bar perse except for where the bartender actually makes the drinks] I had two Pigronis [$12] [gin, campari, and grapefruit juice]. One before my meal [I was feeling pretty good, as the bartender went heavy handed with the gin] and one during. My friend and I shared everything. The waiter recommended 2 small plates and one large, but we got 2 instead [overkill]. Sizzling Sisig [$14]: As everyone else has said, it's amazing. Diced up pork head with a raw egg on top- pretty freakin' ridiculous. It's even more incredible with the coconut rice [$3] [slightly sweet paired with salty].   Mussels [$16]: Equally as delicious as the Sisig. The pineapple curry broth was outstanding, creamy and rich, especially when the shells of the mussels became a  vessel to slurp from. The mantao buns [!!!!!] were so so so good. At first I was confused and thought they were potatoes, potatoes they were not. Crispy Pata [$26]: Fried pork, that's all you really need to know. It was similar to Talde's Korean Fried Chicken. The dipping sauces were an excellent accompaniment. Lamb Neck [$24]: At this point in the meal, we were really full. Then out comes a ginormous lamb neck. Ugh, and that kale and potato puree. Of what I could eat of it, it was delicious. Somehow we actually had dessert. The halo-halo [$8] was pretty good, I think it's better at Talde though. I especially enjoyed the leche flan in it. The ube ice cream, however, was an acquired taste. We spent a pretty penny. About $80 each. Drinks totally jacked up the bill. Still loved it though.
13747	71	3.0	1	2013-12-19	pretty good place that's completely asian fusion.  this place is gotta be owned by a non-Asian (can totally tell by the name of dishes).  Food was pretty decent and quite creative. slightly on the oily side but kinda expected for an Americanized Chinese place.  We had the sizzling sigsig and a chicken soup dish. I would say they taste good, but this type of cuisine is never my favorite.  I would actually give it a 4 star, but I get annoyed by restaurants that only seat full parties (like this place), when we already have the majority of our parties.   Had reservation at 7pm, waited until 7:10 to get our full party there, but didn't get seated until 7:40 which kinda sucks because the place is small and didn't have a big waiting area. The hostess was also a bit rude.
13748	71	4.0	1	2013-12-17	We (a group of 7 friends) did the suckling pig feast and had a really great time! The pig was delicious (and, sadly, pretty cute) as were the rice and veggie sides. Several of us opted to do the self-serve PBR in the back garden - an odd but handy arrangement - and everyone left very full and happy. The staff was really nice and we had a great time.
5558	71	5.0	1	2013-12-15	Loved the sisig and pork jowl, although there was probably more veggies than meat in the pork jowl dish. Definitely get the garlic fried rice with both of those dishes. There's no way to eat it without rice. The bottomless mimosas are great, loved the lychee and watermelon. The food is great, the staff is attentive and they keep the drinks flowing!
7241	71	5.0	1	2013-12-13	Probably my new favorite restaurant! Anything we ordered that was pork, was amazing. (The sirloin was a bit bland.) The place is pretty tiny, so make reservations if you can. Although it was small, they didn't overcrowd the space, which small restaurants in the area tend to do. The brussel sprouts & pig jowl was amazing, so full of flavor. The skin on the large pork leg dish was so crispy and delicious. Pork belly is a must get. We had a group of four and we ordered 6 meat dishes - word of advice, get some sort of veggie dish too as the food is really rich! For someone who loves pork as much as I do, this place was heaven. Even better - the prices are totally reasonable!!
13749	71	4.0	1	2013-12-11	Great food. Friendly, slightly slow service. Good music. Loud environment. Our group of 5 ordered 6 small plates. The unanimous top 3 were the sisig, sirloin, and khao soi. Eat here. You won't be disappointed.
13750	71	4.0	1	2013-12-11	When I walked in I knew I was in store for a great experience. Ahhh the aroma! Grilled pork jowl with brussel sprouts, fried oysters, wings, sizzling sisig - perfectly fried egg and pork belly ... Each bit of the tasting hit the spot! Dessert topped it just right. The staff was vey attentive. Overall, a great time.
9368	71	4.0	1	2013-12-08	Like with other Filipino restaus in LES/East Village I come into these establishments  a wee bit  skeptical that something can trump flavors from my childhood. It's not that I wouldn't go home to my Filipino parents cooking but Pig and Khao certainly presents a good alternative. I do find it interesting that unlike the certifiably Filipino owned Maharlika and Jeepney, which have spun traditional dishes into tweaked deliciousness, Cohen fine tunes authenticity. Case in point is their crispy pata that brings me back to lechonan in Manila - Andoks style. Paired with San Miguel beer for pulutan and you'll be a happy camper. The crossover with Thai food is ingenious, capturing some of the spices & kick I sometimes wish was more utilized in Pinoy cuisine. Just one last shout out: the banana fritters (turon) mixed with salted caramel ice cream = dream team combo.
13751	71	4.0	1	2013-12-03	Uber hip place. Casual. And great food. It'll especially be good for people who love savory food, with strong spices, lots of diversity in tastes and flavors.... Although the prices for small plates seem high, still like the mood of the place and how well cooked all their food is. Not saying anything about the authenticity, because this.... was my first time tasting Filipino (westernized? Don't know) food, and as a foreigner, it still tasted 'Filipino'-food like, because of the typical spices and the cute plates
13752	71	5.0	1	2013-12-03	Wow, what a pleasant surprise. Great flavors, normal portions, great all around. Saw that Leah from Top Chef was working there, which was the icing on the pork? Love it, it you are near and have a craving for Thai/ Vietnamese Fusion stop by you will be glad you did.
13753	71	4.0	1	2013-12-01	"Wow, totally unexpected and really REALLY delish. I'm Thai-American and lived in Thailand for 7 years.  So, I expect a lot out of Southeast Asian food.  Sadly, I feel like NYC is pretty dismal in terms of Southeast Asian food, particularly Thai food. I'm not super familiar with Filipino food and I'm not a huge fan of ""fusion"" cuisine but honestly, I loved my experience at Pig and Khao.   Memorable dishes: Pork Belly Adobo Sizzling Sisig Khao Soi Cod In Banana Leaf Looking forward to going back."
13754	71	3.0	1	2013-11-30	I liked Pig and Khao, but not as much as I had anticipated. Went with a few friends and we made a reservation.  Our table was ready when we got there and we sat right away.  The restaurant and tables were small, so we were pretty cozy.   Our server was great.  He walked us through the menu and HIGHLY recommended the tasting menu (basically told us we'd be stupid not to do it)...so that's what we did. I would say out of the 5 dishes I really liked the Oysters, Pork w/Brussels Sprouts and Turon dessert.  (I'll warn you the Brussels Sprouts were quite salty, but I like that)  The Chicken Wings and Sizzling Sisig were ok (Sisig was a little too fatty).   I'm not a Filipino expert, but I have definitely had better.  But overall the food was good and we had a good time!
13755	71	5.0	1	2013-11-29	"I Can't get enough!! Wait staff was exceptional the last two times I've dined in. All of the dishes were fantastic! Highlights: Sizzling Sisig: I cannot tire of that perfectly done egg and perfectly textured ""pig face"" Pork Belly Adobo: MELTS in your mouth. Shaved Ice dessert was out of control. I don't usually like sweets, but the cubes of coconut gelatin/taro ice cream just blew my mind. And drinks: Spicy Pakwan is yumzzz. really spicy, really delish. Highly recommended. Chef's 5 course Tasting menu is the obvious deal here. You get to try so many yummy things and the portions are great. And if there's something on the menu that you definitely don't want to miss out on, just let them know and they'll incorporate it in your tasting! Green Mango salad was alright. The salad was great, but the chicken was so bland (perhaps compared to the savory dishes we had otherwise). Definitely coming back."
13756	71	1.0	1	2013-11-26	The food is ok, but could be better without the attitude. The hostess named Trina tried to kick us out of the table when we ordered coffee and tea after our dinner.  Rude and inhospitable.  Fire this woman. Terrible and would never come here again.  Avoid this blonde woman TRINA! There are thousands of restaurants in the city, don't give your money to this one.
8817	71	4.0	1	2013-11-24	Filipino fusion is trending in NY of late but so far I haven't been impressed too much. Of course, being Filipino makes me hard to please in this regard. I want a restaurant that would simultaneously remind me of home while being able to compete in the NY food scene. Of the Filipino restaurants I've been to in NY, my favorite is Purple Yam in Brooklyn. Like Purple Yam, Pig and Khao is authentic but it's also trendier, not just with its LES location but with the restaurant's decor, hip atmosphere, and even its choice of soundtrack. After my first visit I've definitely decided that it's going to be my go to Filipino spot in Manhattan. But for now I'm holding off on giving them a 5th star because the service was not that great when we went for brunch and I'd like to see if the food will be consistently good. Since we were there for weekend brunch a couple of us tried their unlimited mimosas. I recommend the mango over lychee or watermelon. For the food, we ordered the sizzling sisig, the classic 'longsilog' which is sausages and eggs, and the curry noodles. One thing I'd say they are doing wrong is that none of the brunch entrees come with garlic fried rice even though typical Filipino breakfasts always always come with rice. That said, the sisig is exactly how it should be and is delicious! I've heard good things about their halo-halo but we were quite full for dessert so I'll have to try that another time. Over all the food was great but like I said, the hostess/waitress was not very friendly. Hopefully that's an exception rather than the norm. I'm looking forward to eating my way down their menu!
13757	71	4.0	1	2013-11-24	Made reservations on a friday night at 6pm, it wasn't busy at first but when we started our meal, it became busy. The food came out fast and server waited to send in the rest of our order when our table had a few dishes already. Water was constantly being refilled and when we finished our drinks, servers came right away to ask if we will like another round. Service overall was pretty good! The restaurant is a bit small, seems like they have a out door seating in the back. Green Mango Salad - really enjoyed this refreshing dish. The chicken was grilled perfectly. This dish is a bit spicy though! Sizzling Sisig - so delish! Love how the dish came with the raw egg on top, we mix it together and eventually the egg will be cooked with the pig head. (i do love pig ear as well) Grilled Sirloin - this one not so much... It was really just ok. I wouldn't order this again since there were nothing special about this dish. Grilled Pork Jowl - this dish was my favorite! the brussel sprouts, to the grilled pork jowl, to sauce!! I will have to order this every time i come back now! Love how they give such a big portion of rice as well. well worth the 3 dollars! We didn't make it to dessert but maybe next time.
13758	71	1.0	1	2013-11-22	I came here about a week ago with my friends and was really looking forward to the food. The pork we ordered was good as well as the coconut rice. The reason for the lackluster review is because as we were waiting for our order of  coffee and tea, the manager came by to tell us the table was over its time limit, since our full party was not on time. The owner came back to apologize realizing we were upset, but the manager's lack of service and rude attitude left me with a bad taste in my mouth.
13759	71	4.0	1	2013-11-21	Went with a group of friends in the summer - was DYING, because there was no A/C and it made for a very unpleasant atmosphere.  Minus the A/C situation though, the food was delicious and we went to town on the following dishes, all of which I would recommend: - Pork belly adobo -  Grilled sirloin -  grilled pork jowl -  chinese sausage salad -  coconut rice -  crispy pata -  baby back ribs -  Khao soi -  Chicharron They also had great watermelon cocktails and some watermelon beer when we were there, but I think that was probably seasonal.
9821	71	2.0	1	2013-11-20	I love Pig and Khao's space - the decor, colors and open kitchen make the place feel warm and cozy. When you walk through the door, you can already smell the sweet aromas of curry and sizzling sisig. I came here on a Tuesday night and it was still quite bustling with people. They have a 5 course menu for $39 where the entire table has to participate, we passed on this option and ordered these three small dishes: Cod In Banana Leaf - turmeric curry, coconut cream Grilled Pork Jowl - brussel sprouts, toasted rice, lime-chili, fish sauce, herbs Khao Soi - red curry, coconut milk, chicken, egg noodles,pickled mustard greens, shallots I felt that overall, everything was too salty for my liking. If we hadn't ordered the rice, I don't think I would've been able to eat the dishes by themselves. I'm also upset that they don't carry garlic rice! I was looking so forward to this. Even though I had a great time and enjoyed the space, I've had better Filipino food elsewhere and I probably won't be returning here anytime soon.
13760	71	2.0	1	2013-11-11	I had brunch here with a girlfriend the other week, because who doesn't find the premise of bottomless mimosas appealing? We arrived at noon, and they must have just opened because we were one of the first to be seated. Which was fortunate, since it got pretty crowded about 45 minutes later. The space is quite small, and the décor is nothing special. To be honest, I was uncomfortably chilly since they kept the front door and back window open the entire time. Fast forward to the food and drinks: The lychee mimosas were delicious, but weak. And the mango mimosa tasted pretty awful, considering they served it to me at room temperature instead of chilled. Which was quite disappointing since we paid $15 for the unlimited drink upgrade, and I expected more out of it. The Sizzling Corned Beef Hash was overcooked, and the Bahn Xeo was ultra greasy - yuck. Their Garlic Fried Rice tastes exactly how my mom makes it, though. Overall, I was pretty annoyed with paying $40 for a mediocre meal with small portions, weak drinks, and slow service. I grew up eating delicious authentic Filipino food my entire life, and neither of our main dishes packed much flavor to even compare. Our waiter also kept bugging us every five minutes to ask if we were done. All they wanted to do was usher us out as soon as possible so they could seat another party. No thank you, I won't be coming back.
13761	71	4.0	1	2013-11-10	Adobo is my favorite filipino dish, so much so I named my first dog Adobo. Pig and Khao's pork belly adobo is now officially my favorite version. I'm going to order 4 for myself next time. And a few bowls of coconut rice. Also, highly recommend the pork jowl and of course the sisig. One last note for the uninitiated, USE A SPOON AND FORK TO EAT. nothing grinds my gears more than seeing filipino food eaten with chopsticks.
13762	71	4.0	1	2013-11-09	"I went there with my bf. We got two small dishes. He ordered the sizzling sissig, and I ordered the pork belly. We also got chicharrones, and coconut rice. I love the coconut rice - I think that was my favorite dish of the whole experience lol! It was really flavorful, oh man I could eat that whole bowl of rice without other side dishes. I didn't dare to try the sissig in the first place because it was pork face and I, as self defined, am a ""traditional meat eater"". But it was actually very good. The texture was soft, and different from other parts of a pig I think. I like the pork belly a lot. The skin was very chewy and the sauce tasted really good. The only not very nice experience was the waiter. As we were ordering, he suggested us get one big dish and two small dishes. But we ordered only two small ones as we thought we weren't that hungry - and to be fair, two small dishes looked like a lot of food already. As we told him that if we wanted more after finishing we would order another one, he ""friendly"" responded, ""Ok but I just want to remind you that all dishes are prepared family style, and it takes a lot of work for the kitchen to prepare dishes that way so I don't suggest you order separately if you were to order more."" ...What???...That was weird."
13763	71	5.0	1	2013-11-07	We went for brunch and found the menu quite innovative and different. Food was delightfully spicy and very flavorful. Will definitely try again.
13764	71	5.0	1	2013-11-05	So good.  Went once, must go back again.  Hope I find no reason to change my rating.  So far this is a one-timer, and so its a soft 5 stars until we meet again. Went with my lovely lady and had pork jowl with watermelon chunks, light spicy sauce, pork rinds, some garnish and other stuff - excellent meld of flavors, binding together very nicely for a special experience.  Also had their sisig, which was also supremely yummy in my tummy, along with some rice.
13765	71	5.0	1	2013-11-05	Awesome food, but what made me write in was the awesome service.   I'm out to dinner with 4 friends, and 3 of us were cool with family style, but two of us had eating restrictions, so ordered their own thing.  Plates and plates heaping with delicious food come out, and we are chowing down.   After awhile, I notice one of my friends who ordered solo hasn't gotten her dish yet, but they are starting to clean out the kitchen for the night.  I point out the issue to the waiter, and he takes care of it, no problem. Should we have been on top of order more quickly (if only to get some food in our hungry friend)?  Could they have pointed out the order wasn't on the original ticket, that they had cleaned the kitchen for the night, that they couldn't make the dish, that they wanted us to pay and get out so they could go home after a long night?  Yes to all of those things.   But they were polite, got delicious food in my by-then-starving friend, and let us hang around while the closed and cleaned everything else so my friend could finish. Two takeaways - my friend should speak up sooner, and Pig & Khao treats people right.  Much appreciated, will be back.
6962	71	5.0	1	2013-11-04	Second visit to Pig and Khao and it was just as good as the first. Of course I didn't learn my lesson from last time and ordered way too much food. Next time I will definitely know better. To start we had the shrimp toast which was a special and they were very good. The shrimp pate on top was much firmer than I expected, but that was a good surprise, I preferred it that way. The Chinese Sausage salad was still a nice bright option, but slightly heavy handed on the vinegar. Coconut rice and Pork Belly Adobo were absolutely amazing just like last time. I think I could just have these two dishes next time and be happy. We also tried the mussels this time, which were okay, but I wasn't a fan of the fried bao. By the time we got to the Khao Soi, we were stuffed but still quite a good dish. I suggest not mixing everything up like they recommend and just enjoying the crispy wontons separately. Once they get incorporated into the sauce, it just gets super soggy. To end we had the turon which were just okay. The chocolate sauce was not a sauce at all but way too thick to be of any use. Still it was a great meal with quick service and I will be back for that coconut rice and pork belly adobo for sure!
13766	71	4.0	1	2013-11-03	Pretty good. Would come again. The food's a bit on the heavy, greasy side, but you can hit the gym afterwards. The sisig is a sizzling plate of pork head, liver, chili, and raw egg. The server told us to mix it all up so as to cook the egg. The plate's not much to look at, as it's essentially chopped meat sizzling on a platter, but it is delicious. I do wish there were more liver to it, though. In fact, I didn't even realize there was supposed to be liver in it. The crispy pork belly with poached egg is a looker, but it was lacking in flavor compared to the sisig. Also, by the time the pork got to us, it was a bit cold. However, the pork skin was satisfyingly crispy, and the egg was poached perfectly. I think the star of the meal was the dessert. We got the halo halo because it sounded so foreign to us, but it's pretty much a taro-ish shaved ice with various condiments, such as flan, ice cream, Rice Crispies(TM), and various other Filipino items I'm not familiar with. There is some kind of tuber in there that I could have done without, but it's easy to eat around them. Overall, absolutely delicious. I would stop by just for the halo halo.
13767	71	5.0	1	2013-11-01	One of the best restaurants I have eaten at in 2013 (and I really like to eat out, lol). Given that its in LES the price on the booze is very reasonable and the cocktails are strong and good.  Terrific combo, especially for around 12. Food is why the wife and I have been here 3 times.  Curries are very good, we always get the Khao-Soi which is in my opinion one of the best curry dishes I have ever had.  Very rich and full of flavor, you can tell they made it right and took their time. Crispy tata is why God invented pork, amazing. Will definitely be back!
13768	71	3.0	1	2013-10-29	I went here for brunch with a good friend of mine.  Thought it would be a nice change from the typical eggs-and-bacon type of place.  We both started off with the Vietnamese style coffee, which was good, but at $3 for a shot's work of coffee, not a good value at all.  I had two sips and was done.  For our entrees, we both got the khao soi and an order of garlic rice each - food was really delicious.  Nice, hot curry, great egg noodles, and the rice was so full of flavor! The reason I give this place 3 stars is not really the food, because that part is actually quite good.  The first reason is that I walked into the restaurant and it was almost 100% empty.  I went to the host and told him I had a reservation, and he told me I could not be seated until my friend arrived.  It was sort of odd, given the place was empty.  At least let me sit and order a coffee?  The second thing is the worst part - the MUSIC.  Oh my gosh.  I could barely hear my friend during our entire meal.  Loud, obnoxious, clubby music blasting from the open kitchen.  And the fact that the restaurant was empty the whole time made it even more annoying - it's like the staff was having a blast, to the dismay of their only patrons.  I get that they want to create a cool atmosphere, but people go out to eat together to talk, and this made it impossible.  I would probably not come back here for this reason alone.
13769	71	3.0	1	2013-10-28	"I had to check this place out to give homage to my roots and with all the hype I hear about it, I just had to make the reservations. I personally think that fililpino cuisine should not be ""fusioned"" or ""fancified"" because it loses its draw and essence. It's meant to be homey and at times gritty and odd. But thanks to GQ, Filipino fusion cuisine is apparently the new thang! the place was average. on the smaller side. they did have back patio seating where we ended up with our table. they had hip hop and rap blaring on their sound system as expected from any Asian restaurant. we had the dollar pbr to drink which was a really good steal, and I was really excited that they serve san Miguel beer! for food we had the khao soi. it was really spicy but really savory. the noodles were mediocre, pretty good sized serving. we had the cod cooked in banana leaves and coconut milk. I was surprised at how small the portion was! the fish was the size of my middle finger. anyway, it was tasty. lots of flavor and we ate it with the coconut rice. their coconut rice is the sweeter kind. it was really good. nice and fluffy. we also ordered the steak. it was sliced sirloin and it came with a chili sweet sauce. it was really good. steak was cooked well and the sauce was pretty delicious. overall a good tasting meal. a little on the pricier side and I was disappointed that the menu did not have that many Filipino dishes and it was mixed with some Vietnamese ones. worth checking out and a cute, trendy place to dine in les. I will still probably just go to queens to get some real Filipino food."
13770	71	4.0	1	2013-10-22	Super delicious.  Went with a group of about 7 of us and we ordered tons of dishes.  Be prepared to order 2 or 3 of the same dishes if you're with a big group because the food goes fast.  The Pork Leg/knuckles were amazing.  Yeah, crazy but it was super good with no bones and tons of flavor.
9219	71	5.0	1	2013-10-18	I've been dying to try Pig and Khao and it was worth the wait! We went for dinner tonight and found it on an unassuming street on the lower east side. The inside of the restaurant was also very unassuming -- much smaller than I was expecting with a sweet outdoor seating area in back strung with multicolored christmas lights. Our server was very friendly and as a Top Chef fan I was excited to see Leah Cohen working the bar! To start the drinks were seriously delicious - we tried one which was a take on a negroni made with gin, campari, vermouth, cardamom syrup and grapefruit juice. I do not usually like the taste of gin but thought this was incredible. We also tried their take on a dark and stormy, which used sherry and ginger...also excellent. The food was delicious as well. The server suggested two small plates, one large plate and one side of rice for two people. We found this to be too much food but it was so tasty we took it home as leftovers. We started with the sizzling sisig and the khao soi (recently reviewed in Time Out). Both were flavorful and lovely. I was surprised, though, that there was no warning on the menu that the khao soi was SPICY. I love spice but this was a little bit too much. For someone who doesn't like spicy food at all this dish would have been a disastrous choice. We had the coconut rice as a side which helped soothe our burning mouths a bit. The highlight of the meal was the large plate of BBQ baby back ribs - I would go back just to eat plates and plates of these ribs. Big fan of Pig and Khao.
5705	71	4.0	1	2013-10-16	For a joint birthday dinner, our group of 10 people ended up at Pig & Khao for some Asian Fusion/Filipino food. I've had Filipino food before - the legit kind that you only find in the middle of Queens - so my standards are set pretty high. About half of us arrived right on time for our 6pm reservation while the other half was a bit later. They offer Happy Hour drinks until 7pm so we opted to get something to drink while waiting. All cocktails are $8 while glasses of Prosecco and Riesling are $5. They're pretty generous with their wine pours so I think it's their best bet. I had the Banana Leaf Cod ($14.00) with a big bowl of Coconut Rice ($3.00). The cod was cooked perfectly but it was definitely a bit on the spicy side. Three of my friends got the Sizzling Sisig ($14.00), which is pork head cooked with chili and whole egg on a hot plate. I've had Sisig before and Pig & Khao's version was pretty good. It wasn't as spicy as your traditional sisig, which was nice. They do allow cakes but there is a fee - I wasn't sure if it was a $6 fee per cake or per slice. Either way, either get dessert here or find somewhere else to cut the cake.
13771	71	4.0	1	2013-10-14	"I heard about this place from some article. I told my sister about it and her two friends and I made reservations for brunch on a Sunday. Even though the rest of my party showed up 45 minutes late, they were able to seat us. I ordered a coffee, which they only do ""vietnamese style"" with milk. I got a very small coffee for $3. Even though they do bottomless mimosas and draft beer for $15, we decided not to be a hot mess that day. My sister and I ordered sizzling sisig (pig head) and garlic fried rice. We also ordered powdered donuts  ($8) with custard which came green but delicious. Prices look affordable online but then when none of the dishes come with rice (EVERY FILIPINO DISH NEEDS RICE), it fools you.  Our friends also ordered the sizzling sisig and champorado (chocolate rice pudding). Everything was delicious and sharing the entrees was a great idea. It left us full but not overly full. Flavors are great. It's a cute spot and very well decorated but not sure that any of these dishes would make me come back time and time again."
13772	71	3.0	1	2013-10-14	Made reservations for 8:30 on a Tuesday night. The place was surprisingly packed. They have a tasting menu for $35 person, requires each member at the table to participate. We decided to order the dishes we wanted instead. - Sizzling sisig, pork head, chili, whole egg $14 - Khao soi, red curry, chicken, egg noodles $16 - Crispy pata, friedpork leg,  $26 - Market Veggies, I think it was chinese broccoli, much needed after all that meat! $7 - Coconut rice $3. We made the mistake of ordering two. One order is plenty for two people FYI - they have an open kitchen so if you sit indoors your clothes and hair will reek when you leave, as bad if not worse than going to a korean bbq joint.
12874	71	4.0	1	2013-10-13	Get yourself the pork jowl, crispy pata, and the sigsig.  There's not much else that needs to be said.  I guess if you're wondering, this would be a fun date spot if you don't mind heading so far into the LES.  But yes, just go here and order everything because I bet all of the food is really good...
13773	71	3.0	1	2013-10-10	The food  is very outstanding, but the service they provided aren't on the same level. Our birthday table wait for so long for our drinks and waitress seems very cloudy, felts like we have to please her in order to get our things. Not a recommended place for party or for dating, but if u don't mind the service it's a good place to try.
13774	71	2.0	1	2013-10-04	Was not presented the specials, yes I did say I was ready to order... but I didn't realize there were specials. Received a not so friendly and seemingly rushed/irritated lecture on small plates. Ordered and food was so poorly timed it was almost inedible. (Why would you bring very spicy greens out last, long after all other plates were consumed?) As our plate with spicy greens was being removed from our table the juices made their way all over my wallet and my friends papers. Unfortunately, the food didn't make up for service. Mediocre at best. If you appreciate food it's not really worth going here. If you appreciate plastic plates and kegs of PBR have fun.
13775	71	4.0	1	2013-10-04	"In spite of the ongoing lawsuit between Leah Cohen and Rick Camac's New York Restaurant Services Group, I knew I had to come here to satisfy my currently insatiable Filipino food cravings. (But P&K is technically Asian fusion cuisine.) We made a reservation for two on a warm summer evening interrupted by bouts of torrential downpours. The food undoubtedly left an impression on us. We started with the Sizzling Sisig, of course. Once the raw egg is mixed and the limes squeezed, you are ready for the flavor and texture explosion. Think bite-sized pork fat (head), except diced into small cubic squares. Each spoonful is a surprise; it can be crispy or chewy, it might go down easily, it could be that gelatinous fat you always peel off the meat (I still do that), it might snap, crackle, and pop (literally) in your mouth -- but stop thinking and just swallow. You will discover that the chili, lemongrass, and lime cut right into the salty and smoky/burnt flavors of the pork. The Khao Soi was my personal favorite. It's essentially a ninja Thai red curry where the coconut milk washes over before the heat (mild spiciness) attacks. Underneath an ostentatious arrangement of crispy fried noodles, the egg noodles sit quietly (I was truly surprised by it) in the curry. Once thoroughly mixed, each bite will be that strangely exciting mixture of chewy and crispy, yet again. Be wary that the crispy noodles will get soggy if they sit in the curry too long. (Then it's just chewy and mushy.) The Halo Halo was interesting in an I-don't-understand-why-people-like-this way. It just seemed like a hodgepodge of leftover ingredients in the fridge, but we really tried to enjoy it! He and I both liked the leche flan and the pinipig (glutinous rice), but we picked out the plantains (that wasn't on the menu!). The ube (taro) ice cream was delicious of course. Lastly, the service was pretty good. The hostess apologized that we had to wait past our reservation time and even offered us drinks on the house (we sadly did not take up her offer). Our server was very attentive and continually checked in on us. My only gripe was that when two vagrants wandered in at the end of the night, NONE of the staff did anything. They literally stood and pointed at the two (drunk?) men yelling nonsensical words across the table. After 10 minutes or so, they left on their own. All the diners, us included, were bewildered at what happened. Since Cohen is trying to cut ties with the restaurant, the future direction of the restaurant is certainly questionable. Do come and try P&K soon, before it's too late! Notes: - Khao is Thai for rice. Not a homophonous play on the word ""cow,"" like I originally thought haha. - Definitely order rice with your dishes. I personally didn't want to eat straight pork fat, but it will also help fill you up more. - The space echoes, so it can get quite loud."
13776	71	3.0	1	2013-09-30	"I came here on a Monday. I was waiting for a friend to join me for dinner. After 20 mins of waiting for my friend, I decided to ask for a table so I can order a drink and appetizer while I wait. I told the hostess this and she tells me ""we can't sit you till the whole party is here"" I looked around and said , ""are you serious, no one is here?!"" She said ""store policy"".  I don't understand what the big deal was when the restaurant was empty! I could've had 5 expensive drinks and happily paid while I waited but instead they denied me of this service. I walked out cuz ""store policy""/service sucks khao balls"
13777	71	2.0	1	2013-09-23	If you like great food and absolutely awful service, this is the place for you.  Made a reservation on OpenTable and requested an outside seat if available.  After being greeted upon our arrival with a pained 'Yeah?' by our hostess, we were shown to our table that was smack dab in front of the entrance, despite every other table except one in the entire restaurant being vacant.  Inquired about my request for an outdoor table, and was told you cannot reserve a table there.  Seeing through the window that the back was about 60% empty, I asked if we could sit there anyways.  Nope, 'those tables are reserved.' ... My wife's salad was fantastic... and I know this because it came out 20 minutes before my food was served.  It gave me time to sip and savor my tiny $3 vietnamese coffee which did not come with refills (and they offer no other coffee option) because how can they expect to make money if they just kept giving me coffee for free while I waited 30 minutes for food in an empty restaurant? My dish arrived with 2 plastic plates marred by scratch marks and stains.  Apparently our dishes were meant to be shared despite the first one not having any plates accompanying it.  It also was very delicious.  It was so good that the waitstaff wanted it for themselves because I repeatedly had to tell them I wasn't finished yet as they attempted to take it away and clear our table. Our check was simply placed on our table and then we were ignored until we paid and left.  The outdoor tables remained empty. I may eat here again, but it would most certainly have to be carry-out.
13778	71	4.0	1	2013-09-19	The food is great here, I eat here often. The music may be a little loud so try the patio if you want a quieter meal. I'll be back.
13779	71	4.0	1	2013-09-19	Being Filipina, I usually don't like variations on Filipino food. However, I thought this place was delicious! The pork belly adobo was really good. I thought the adobo sauce was very authentic. Sisig was pretty authentic as well. Really cool vibe, loved the music. Honestly didn't think Filipino food could be trendy but I stand corrected! Only complaint was that the pork was particularly fatty. Although I myself love the fat, my friend thought it was a bit too much. Will definitely be back though!
5572	71	5.0	1	2013-09-13	Always a good sign when place has a small menu: you know they're good at what they do. Seared pork belly was amazing, coconut rice, and accompaniments, and everything else I saw looked delicious. Great service, and they gladly accommodated food allergies which is super important.
13780	71	4.0	1	2013-09-12	Their brunch is pretty good, have yet to try dinner. I've eaten here a few times with friends so I got to try a bunch of dishes: - sausage (can't remember if it was the longonissa or the chinese sausage salad) - not worth trying; my friend got this dish and it looked so sad next to the rest of ours as there wasn't much food on it - Green mango salad - I liked it, but towards the end of the dish, I got sick of the tangy mango because there was so much of it. I replaced the shrimp with bacon since I'm allergic to shrimp and them gave me a lot of bacon (is there such a thing??) - Sizzling corned beef hash - must try, close second to the next dish - Sizzling sisig - must try; this is the dish I got the first time I ate at Pig and Khao and my friends and I all determined it the best one ^both of the sizzling dishes are brought out in hot cast iron dishes so you egg cooks in front of you Last but not least, you HAVE to get the garlic fried rice. I try not to eat carbs too much (by try, I mean that I really want to eat less carbs, but it's so hard), but this rice is just too damn good. Because of the rice and sizzling sisig (moreso the rice), I give them 4 stars.
5713	71	4.0	1	2013-09-12	At 9:30ish on a Wednesday, no wait plenty of tables available. You can also make reservations on opentable. AMAZING sisig and pork belly. Unfortunately they don't have garlic rice for dinner......................not understanding why. Coconut rice was really good though. The sisig had the perfect egg, and perfect amount of crisp/fat ratio in the cartilage. Great to share with 1 other person. The pork belly also had really good crisp/fat ratio. Comes with four slices. Might be my new favorite flip place!
13781	71	4.0	1	2013-09-09	Excellent food! Service is pushy. Reallll pushy. We were a group of 7 and they suggested 7 small plates and 3 entrees. We ordered 4 small plates and 2 entrees and had more than enough food. Seriously. Just look at the tables next to you and gauge from there. Recommendations: Small Plates - Sizzling Sisig, Khao Soi (warning: spicy!), Green Mango Salad Large Plates - Crispy Pata (the tables favorite), Whole Fried Fish Leah Cohen was milling around while we were there and even served the couple next to us. Was nice to see her manning the ship. I will return and hopefully sit at the chef's table. Loved it!
13782	71	4.0	1	2013-09-08	Everything I had at Pig and Khao had new flavor combinations to me and I loved every one! We shared the scallops/curry (my favorite), the cod/banana leaf (my close second favorite), and the pork belly, with coconut rice & greens on the side. I also ordered a young coconut to drink from, which made me sooo happy.  (Hint -- the flesh of a young coconut is very soft, so ask them to cut the coconut in half when you're done drinking from it, and you can eat the inside!) For dessert, get the halo-halo (big enough to share)! It has all these amazing flavors in it -- the sweetness from the milk and caramel from the flan go well with the ice cream (was that yam?), and the added texture from the crispy rice and ice was just awesome. It is easy to fall into a rut in NY dining in terms of always grabbing the standard Italian, American, Thai, Japanese, etc. foods. I am SO happy that a friend recommended we try this Filipino/fusion restaurant, it was a great night.
13783	71	4.0	1	2013-09-05	Great brunch experience! All the entrees were good, with slightly  small portions. (it was just enough for me) The unlimited mimosa experience with several options of watermelon, orange, and lychee was amazing. The staff was great and we all really enjoyed our Sunday Funday there.
13784	71	5.0	1	2013-09-03	I'm not a pork eater and yet I've been to Pig & Khao twice in the last month - it's that good! Each time I had the Khao Soi (red curry chicken noodle) which is one of the best asian chicken dishes I've ever tried. I love that the noodle changes texture as it mixes with the curry, and every bite has a little crunch. YUMMM. I came here with two different people - both ordered the sizzling sisig and they seemed to love it. It's also one of their best selling dishes and smells incredible so I would recommend pork eaters to give that a try.
13785	71	3.0	1	2013-09-02	mm...I like that this place is different and it was a good experience. Overall I liked the food, which is definitely more asian fusion than it is filipino food. We ordered 4 small plates - the khao soi (burmese dish - did not taste like the khao soi my burmese family makes, def has more thai influences than burmese), the sisig (yummy, a little on the salty side but so good with rice), the mussels (nice broth, deeper flavor enhanced by the chinese sausage), and the grilled pork jowl (nicely cooked, loved the watermelon) - and the crispy pata (a little too fatty for my liking). I also ordered the rum and coconut water- which was probably not a good idea since I was soo dehydrated from walking around during this hot humid summer day. Then we finished the night off with some halo halo which wasn't bad. I think you would enjoy this restaurant more than me if you are into fatty meats.
13786	71	5.0	1	2013-09-01	It's been over 2 hours since I have been here and I am still raving about all the taste I just encountered at Pig and Khao.. The attention to detail in the food was out of this world. The fact that in one single bite you could taste every single layer of the simple ingredients. It was like a food explosion in your mouth.. This is what we had. GREEN MANGO SALAD | $13 charred chicken, lemongrass, mint, coriander, cashew, dried shrimp Thought: This is by far THE best Salad I have tasted in a long time. You taste every single spice as it melts in your mouth and every texture had a purpose. CRISPY PATA | $26 pork leg, pickled green mango, dipping sauces Thought: Everything about this Dish was amazing. Seriously the simplest dish with two types of dipping sauces.. I was floored!!!! GRILLED SIRLOIN | $15 lettuce, crispy garlic,spicy issan sauce Thought: SAY WHATT!!!! As a main course I was floored by this dish. the Meat was tender and melted in your mouth.. The sauce adds an amazing bit of sweet kick to take it to a whole new level. My Husband housed this in like 5 minutes flat.  I was able to sneak 2 bites in before it vanished. KHAO SOI| 16 red curry, coconut milk, chicken, egg noodles, pickled mustard greens, shallots Thoughts: ummm no words.. I'm speechless.... This was, lets just put it this way I can not wait for the winter because I want that atleast every other weekend!! I just wanted to curl up on a couch and watch a movie and eat this... And if you have a head cold this could possibly clear it out for ya..  lol. And they finished us off with their signature dish.. SIZZLING SISIG | $14 pork head, chili, whole egg Thought: The Chef and I did not tell my husband what this was because I doubt he would of been into this but this is one hell of an adventurous dish. For those who maybe like aww helll naw... seriously  try this.. the pork is tender and has a richer flavor then say a pork tenderloin. Then you add the chili with the egg and I am telling you.. the dish will surprise you! I loved everything about the decor of this place. We sat up close and personal with the chefs and enjoyed even the staff that works there.. I love their choice of old school hip hop and the vibe that flows through the whole restaurant. This place should not be missed!!! If you are in the area, hit this place up.. you will not be let down.
13787	71	4.0	1	2013-08-30	Started off our brunch at Chef Leah's place with a mimosa for Melissa and a Vietnamese coffee for me.  I have to say, first time I had pork head for brunch...but it was delicious.  I had Sizzling Sisig (pork head, chili, whole egg), with a side of garlic fried rice.  Melissa went a little more traditional with Pain Perdu, although this Pain Perdu had an awesome twist.  Bananas, coconut whipped cream and....wait for it....wait for it...Genesee cream syrup.  Wow, it was outstanding.  We were there when the restaurant opened for brunch so we were the only customers for a little bit, but the waiter was great and the staff were all very nice.  I liked the open kitchen near the center of the restaurant also.  I would definitely go back to Pig and Khao.
13788	71	4.0	1	2013-08-28	Every year I visit NYC I have to try at least one new restaurant. I've just fallen in love with so many of the spots I've dined in before that I can't NOT go to them so my stays either need to get longer, or I need to just stick to the tried and true. But who does that? People that aren't adventurous I guess. Pig and Khao was a new spot I just HAD to try especially since they're part of the Fatty Crew (Fatty Crab Restaurant - my all time favorite). I thought the food was pretty good. I can't say spectacular because I'm all about traditional Filipino food. It seems Pig and Khao is slowly introducing Filipino cuisine in a more fusion-ish kind of way that doesn't totally bombard foreign taste buds with the powerful flavors most Filipino dishes have. It's not to say that their food isn't great. I thought it was tasty and very well presented. The service was decent (they forgot one of our drinks). I can't give a spot 5 stars if they forget an order (especially when they write it down). Maybe I'll come back again next time I'm in the city for a 2nd run =)
13789	71	5.0	1	2013-08-26	An all around great meal. Every dish we had was excellent. And props to the restaurant for being able to accommodate our large party of 8. Service was excellent. And you can't beat the $15 unlimited PBR keg in the backyard. I'll definitely be back!
13790	71	1.0	1	2013-08-21	Maybe this is unfair, but I was in NYC on vacation. I wanted the best Halo Halo and I heard this was the place. I walked the area and showed up at about 5:45. Walked in and told them I was looking for the best Halo Halo in NYC and wanted to get it to go. I was told that thy didn't open till 6 and didn't make things to go, but I was free to come back then. Hmmm, the restaurant business is a tough gig and you would think they would want my business. Maybe not, so I will find Halo somewhere else. It is a shame, sounds like people like this place. I would have liked the chance to have that experience!
13791	71	5.0	1	2013-08-21	First of all, my boyfriend used to come here with his friends and he said this place was really great. So he had been trying to take me here many times and finally we made it! On Saturday night we decided to try and get here around 10 pm. It wasn't too crowed and the decorations were cool. We ordered Grilled sirloin, Pork belly and Mussels. I just wanna tell you guys that I'm totally in love with Grilled sirlion, because the spicy sauce it came with was really awesome! It made me think of my favorite spot in my hometown (Thailand). Moreover, they cooked their beef medium rare so it wasn't too dry and pretty soft! By the way, my boyfriend looked like he really enjoyed his food. He loves Pork belly and Mussels, and I guess he finished those dishes within 10 mins. lol Ooh... I almost forget to tell you: Don't forget to try coconut rice because it's absolutely amazing and I'm pretty sure you will like it instead if Jasmin rice! :)
13792	71	5.0	1	2013-08-19	Had such a great time at Pig and Khao for brunch! Seriously, great service, great food, great drinks and great space. For the food: I got the Pork Jowl, which was delicious. Perfectly grilled with great flavor, which was really brought to life with the watermelon and mint salad. We also got a side of the garlic rice. Also great and only served at brunch! We splurged and got the chocolate rice pudding with bacon for dessert. Perfect end to the meal. All the food was accompanied by the $15 AYCD mimosas in 4 flavors (lychee - the best, watermelon - second best, mango - great, but a little too sweet, orange - i didn't try this). For anyone who likes cheap beer, there is also an AYCD, self-serve PBR deal The services was wonderful! Our glasses were never empty and they were very on top of things. The waiter was helpful when looking over the menu and answering questions. Very cute little garden space in the back for nice days. Seriously might be my new favorite brunch place! Excited to go back.
5503	71	3.0	1	2013-08-16	"After hearing so much praise for Pig & Khao in all the food review sites / blogs, I think I came in with overmanaged expectations. There seems to be an insurgence of popularity of Southeast Asian cuisine lately between Mission Chinese, Maharlika, Uncle Boon's etc. Pig & Khao is buried on a desolate street in the LES. It's actually quite noisy in the restaurant because they blast 90s hip hop / rap, but the outdoor garden in the back is a nice place for a meal. We ordered the Sizzling Sisig, Khao Soi, and Grilled Pork Jowl salad. The Sizzling Sisig is quite good: pork, runny egg, lime and all these spices served up on a sizzling fajita plate. It's delicious at first fork but gets to be a little too heavy and greasy after a couple of bites. The Grilled Pork Jowl was the weakest dish. It kind of looked like pork rinds served up with cut up watermelon. The Khao Soi is a red curry that also has egg noodles in it. It came in a deep bowl buried under mounds of fried noodle strips. Even to a spice wimp like myself, it wasn't too hot and was completely manageable, especially when paired with the... ....COCONUT RICE! Since when does a side as boring as rice become the star of the show?! I could've eaten an entire bowl of this rice, plain. It was coconutty-licious. For dessert I destroyed the Halo-halo. It's a teeming bowl overloaded with shaved ice, coconut, ice cream, pieces of rich flan... I deluded myself into thinking that it was ""healthy"" because it was mostly shaved ice, conveniently omitting the part where it's also laden with a million decadent toppings. This dessert pushed my stomach into the over-ate, uncomfortable arena, but I was quite content there."
13793	71	4.0	1	2013-08-15	Came here for my bday dinner with the hubby and a couple of our good friends on a Wednesday night. The ambiance and vibes were great. It def put us in a good mood. We chose to go with the tasting menu -5 courses including dessert. It was an excellent choice! At first we thought the guys will still be hungry in the end, but once we got the big plates, it was easy to see that we would be stuffed way before we finished. Food was excellent! Dessert was also good. ddnt really care for the fried dough tho. (Idk how that's even Filipino or Thai.) We are Filipinos and the infused Thai flavors went well with the dishes. And most of all, service here was great! Would def recommend to all.
13794	71	5.0	1	2013-08-15	"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Manhattan!  I am a Top Chef fan and a foodie and this restaurant is exciting NOT JUST because Chef Leah Cohen is visible giving commands from the open kitchen, but because it provides creative and delicious food at a great price.  And heck, $15 for unlimited PBR dont hurt either.  Have been there twice now, once at the chef's table and once in the garden out back.  Both were amazing experiences with phenomenal service.  We didnt have reservations either time and were seated within 20 minutes.  It stays pretty full the entire night without being ""crammed"" or huge waiting lists."
13795	71	4.0	1	2013-08-12	The food was unique and delicious.  The maitre d seemed to be having an off day but our waitress was helpful and friendly.  We tried 3 appetizers - scallops in green curry, pork jowl with watermelon, and fried oysters.  They were all flavorful and colorful, but the fried oysters were my favorite.  We were worried the jowl would be fatty and heavy but the watermelon helped to balance it out and keep it refreshing.  The drinks all had a summery Asian spin which were unique as well.  I look forward to going back.
13796	71	3.0	1	2013-08-11	The dishes are quite small for the price. However, there were some delicious dishes: - Pata was really tasty - Sisig was delicious and probably the best dish on their menu - Adobo had a really nice sauce included The market greens was probably half a side portion (if that) in other restaurants. The food was promising... just wish there was a better portion size.
13797	71	4.0	1	2013-08-11	Great service, great food, interesting ambiance - played DMX, Wu Tang etc. - and asian food, which was great.  The pig face and curry were especially good.
13798	71	5.0	1	2013-08-10	"Pig & Khao (nice pun) finds hitherto hidden connections between Filipino and Thai cuisine, turning them into an exquisite combination that in earlier times might be considered Pan-Asian fusion. Not that there's anything so crass going on here. The khao soi, a soup noodle dish native to Southern Thailand, is a fire-hot take on the dish, with the coconut milk not hiding a hint of the chili heat in the broth. Meanwhile pork adobo, a spin on the Philippines national dish rests in a bowl with a full poached egg and Sichuan peppercorns lightly numbing the fatty meat on the tongue. The cod is a bit too salty, something that probably resulted in the recent switch in fish from salmon, which absorbs the flavor better. It was rainy on the night I came here, so we couldn't take in the impressively large outdoor space. But I wonder if such lovingly prepared fare should have to compete with flies and the hissing of summer lawns. This is food to be savored, arriving at does in irregular but still prompt intervals from the tiny kitchen/bar. The menu divisions here seem designed to confuse, or at least contribute to over ordering. There's nothing ""small"" about the khao soi or curry fried chicken - these are just main dishes that would be served with rice. Figure on ordering just one of these a person, perhaps with an extra one for the table to share. This should keep the cost at around $50 a head with a couple drinks, as opposed to our feast at $70 each. The drink selection is impressively varied, with an all bottle selection that moves from the hipster trash (Pork Slap and Genny) to regional crafts (Itacha Flower) and pricy Asian imports (Hitachiano). Slurping beers out of a bowl ""Hong Kong style"" may be inaccurate and stupid, but at least you sip nice beers while doing it."
13799	71	5.0	1	2013-08-10	The best sisig in NYC! Will go back for their halo-halo as it is not available last time...
12889	71	4.0	1	2013-08-05	Wow, this place is amazing. I loved the grilled pork jowl, and it went perfectly with the watermelon they serve it with. The pork belly adobo was perfect as well and they top it with a pouched egg and perfctly seasoned. Khao soi is probably my favorite, and it's a spicy curry noodle with crispy's on top for texture. It goes perfectly with the coconut rice. Eveyrone raved about the sizzling sisig, but I would say this was my least favorite dish. I enjoyed everything else so much more. For the main, I reallly loved the whole fried fish. It sits in a deicious broth with onions, basil and oyster mushrooms. The reason for minus 1 star is that we sat pretty close to the kitchen and there were two spurts of oily/pungent/eye burning spice attacks from the kitchen. It made us extremely uncomfortable and was burning our eyes like crazy. I didn't know how the people sitting at the kitchen bar could even sit through this, when we were much further away. Besides that, I think this is one of my new favorite restaurants!
13800	71	4.0	1	2013-08-03	Wow, 1st time in, and just what I was looking for, something new and fresh!! Pork done a bunch of ways, and many interesting accoutrements...I'll be back for sure...
13801	71	2.0	1	2013-07-25	Small portions and overrated. I'd rather get something in Chinatown.
12806	71	4.0	1	2013-07-23	If you don't mess with pork, keep movin' sister. This place wax poetics to the pig and does a solid job at it though mind you, this isn't crispy lean pork loin style; this is the fatty belly, jowl, head parts that are seasoned and cooked perfectly, but the fat can't be escaped. Tapas style resulted in my party of 6 ordering literally the whole menu minus a few. The curry noodles were a hit along with that creamy coconut cod wrapped in banana leaf. Order that coconut rice, you know want it. All the pork dishes were a solid with most of them tasting very similar and that's why this may be the most general review in the world. The sisig was delicious, a must order and I'd pass on the pork with watermelon dish. The crispy pata which is under the larger plates was solid, but honestly, by the time it came, I was pigged out. The halo-halo ended up being a delicious cold, creamy concoction of fruity pebbles and I loved every bite. Eating with 90s hip hop as the ambiance? Priceless. I was thinking about giving this place 3 stars since I wasn't that into the food; all that fatty pork left me with a) that was just too much pork I wish there was a tad bit more to my meal and b) what the heck did I just eat, everything tasted very similar. Overall for $50 a person, we left full with a few libations in us, we enjoyed a unique experience, the service was amazing and to top it off, 90s hip-hop. Four stars from this gal.
9331	71	4.0	1	2013-07-22	Service was pretty good. Tried three dishes. Had the pork jowl, sizzling sissig(I think that's how you spell it...), cod in banana leaf (interesting) w choi sum and coconut rice. Very flavorful and interesting mix of Asian food combined. Would come back w larger group as it seems like the group dining choice.
13802	71	5.0	1	2013-07-22	Small, intimate, yet with personality to spare,  Pig and Khao assaults your tastebuds with a broad selection of tapas-style plates that are bound to leave you with a smile on your face. This small Filipino/Thai amalgam in LES grabs you quick and doesn't let go as you receive rapid-fire hot plates that will make you feel like you just got socked in the mouth by a sack full of delicious.  The pork belly was succulent, and seasoned to perfection by the ragtag team in the walk-in closet-sized kitchen.  They make it seem so simple but it sure didn't taste so.  I mean that in the best sense of the word. For the spicy lovers, such as myself, make sure to try the Khao Soi.  A curry-based noodle dish that will definitely have you reaching for your drink a few times.  That nice, slow burn really gets you half way through but champs will make it through no problem. The place is loud but expected.  In this kind of small, rambunctious neighborhood, It's hard to find a place with so much personality that wouldn't be filled with loud, eccentric people that mirror it.  In my opinion, it just adds to the charm of this place because you know that this is a local spot, not a tourist trap.  Word of warning, since the bar is right in front of the diminutive kitchen, the heat that radiates from it is capable of making even an desert egyptian sweat.  I'm sure this will work to many peoples advantage during the wintertime but during the summer, it can be brutal.  My diagnosis would be to keep hydrated with beers throughout. It should be pretty clear by now that I like this place, maybe even biasedly so.  I guess this is just the kind of place that tickles my fancy (floats my boat, raises my flagpole, and any other overused like-kind phrase you wish to apply).  If you are a fan of this kind of cuisines, you owe it to yourself to try it out.
13803	71	4.0	1	2013-07-18	Pretty delicious and fun to boot.  Typical super cool lower east side spot----funky, casual and delicious.  Went twice and I would come back again.  Really love the spin on the chicharron appetizer.  I wouldn't do the chef's tasting menu again though.  also, hate the website design.  pretty near impossible getting to the important info (like location and hours) without the goddamn nytimes rave flashing in my face.  Take a clue from Mission Chinese's website.
13804	71	5.0	1	2013-07-17	I knew I was going to love this place the moment I walked in. The fusion of glorious smells and the friendly staff won me over almost immediately. The sizzling pork head is a must! The jasmine rice is very good. But the soi koi dish is probably the tastiest dish I've had in a long time. I tried to get a bowl to go, but they told me the kitchen was closed, that made me sad. But to be fair, we showed up 15 minutes before they closed and they did not bat an eye. They gave us great service and treated us very well.
13805	71	4.0	1	2013-07-15	"Small little place in the LES. This was my first experience to a ""flip"" restaurant, was different and food was quite flavorful. South east asianfood are very flavorful ingeneral. Love the sizzling sig! Although I think it's a little pricey given the portions and it being South East Asian comfort food.  It was good, but wasn't memorable for me to return twice, ESP with those price tags."
13806	71	4.0	1	2013-07-15	Back again on another Monday night... Went with a friend and had a completely different (better) experience. The restaurant had a few tables available and the entire bar was open. We were seated right away. We ordered bottomless PBR's and the chef's tasting menu $39/each and only available Monday - Wednesday. It was really good, we received: deep fried shrimp with a smokey aioli, scrambled eggs with rice cake, ribs with a side of slaw, perfectly grilled scallops in a green pesto-curry-ish sauce and finished with Halo Halo. I will be back again.
13807	71	4.0	1	2013-07-14	Had a great brunch here with some girlfriends. The mimosas were excellent, but they ran out of lychee half way through our meal, which was a little disaplointing. I would definitely come back again though because my meal was also very excellent- chicharron with watermelon....mmmm..
13808	71	4.0	1	2013-07-08	This spot is awesome. A small joint in the heart of LES, low-key and festive at the same time. GRILLED PORK JOWL - amazing complementary flavors with the pork jowl, texture contrast with chicharrones and toasted rice and my favorite part, the refreshing watermelon cubes + herbs together. It's like a party in your mouth. SIZZLING SISIG - pork head, chili, whole egg... reminds me of my mom's homecooking, rich, deep flavors and nothing pretentious. you need rice for this. CRISPY PATA - pork leg, pickled green mango, with 2 dipping sauces. another texture adventure, so delicious and comforting. the contrast between the deep flavors of the pork + pickled mango... my mouth is watering. My favorite was the pork jowl. I could get a 3 of those by themselves. Cons, there is like barely any a/c. New York summers are not pleasant so that's a little lame. Outside space is nice but does not shield from rain so if it looks like its about to rain skip this place if they don't have space inside. Employees super friendly and chill - sometimes a little lost though.
13809	71	5.0	1	2013-07-06	I am in awe with myself.  I enjoyed eating pork head (sizzling sigsig), Chicharron and drinking the Hell & High watermelon beer and PBR on draft. The watermelon canned beer & PBR on draft are crisp and refreshing - no hoppy or barley taste. In the Sizzling Sigsig, the raw egg mixed in creates a creaminess to the dish. A must-eat with a bowl of rice. The chili is hardly noticeable cuz there slender pieces and add a tiny kick. I can't handle spicy foods and this certainly wasn't spicy. The Chicharron are light and not greasy. The coconut vinegar didn't do much for the chicharron, IMO. Even though I dipped one into the vinegar, I choked on the five spice powder when I breathed in thru my mouth. The 5-spice powder isn't spicy, contrary to my belief. The 3rd item was the Mussels. That broth is amazing - it's like butter & wine, but it's not (it's got to be the yuzu and dashi). I spooned some over rice to enjoy it some more. Waste not, want not.
12463	71	3.0	1	2013-07-01	Another hipster Asian fusion joint in LES. The dishes were decent, I remember they tasted fresh, but honestly nothing super memorable. Had the pork jowl, quail adobo...and something else that I forget. Overpriced for the small portion sizes, and always packed with people who think it's the hip thing to eat ethnic/fusion foods. Go to Maharlika instead if in the city--similar price but better food. And obvi way more better tasting and less expensive options in Queens!
13810	71	1.0	1	2013-07-01	"It started out a great night, we didn't need reservations and we've been wanting to try this place for awhile. But sadly, I have to agree with R.S. below... ""This place is all attitude , without the quality to justify it!"" The facade is trendy, hipster, trying very hard to create that atmosphere. Unfortunately, as they succeed on that front, they fail on everything else. Upon arrival, the service from everyone on staff was slightly less than indignant.  No eye contact, almost reprimanding. We started out with the chicharron, which I was most excited about as I've had my share of chicharron. As it came to our table, I knew instantly it would be a disappointment, it was slathered in a peppery powder but most importantly, it looked and tasted as if were from a store bought package. And even worse, just as stale. This was a huge embarrassment to say the least. Our entrees were the sisig and the pork adobo. Aside from being 90% made of PURE fat, the portions were tiny (Will someone tell these people this isn't Dufresne's WD-50!) and incredibly overpriced. The halo-halo was maybe the biggest disappointment. After spending a summer day walking around, I was excited to try the Halo Halo that was given a great review in NY Magazine. 3 thumbs down, if i had an extra thumb. It was a bowl of ice, milk and a scoop of ice cream with a few pieces of flan and banana. It surely was not made of love, and sure was not well thought out. Let's just throw these items together and call it halo-halo. Certainly not worth the name, unfortunately. Overall, I regret my having to spend close to $200 on a place that clearly called me a ""sucker"" when I signed the bill..."
13811	71	1.0	1	2013-07-01	"THIS PLACE IS RIDICULOUS. YOU SHOULD SUE. You can get better chicaron at Manila Oriental or Pacific Super. What is there to ""halo"" in the Halo-Halo? ..its basically milk & ice! Also, the waiters/waitresses don't have any knowledge as to what filipino food really is. At lastly, the plates look like it's from chinatown which doesn't make the food any more appealing."
13812	71	1.0	1	2013-06-29	This place is ridiculous, it is the worst Filipino food I ever tasted. Small plates not worth it. Over-priced for no reason. Not authentic Filipino food. Seriously need to reevaluate their menu. The only good thing about the place is the music.
13813	71	5.0	1	2013-06-24	BIG fan. It's an exotic place, and if you can get past being a picky eater (or just don't look at what you're eating actually is), it's worth it. *So* worth it. Try the tasting menu- it's about $35/pp and you get 5 or 6 dishes served.  You won't know in advance what you'll get, but you can request a couple of must-haves to be included and they will cater to you.  What's good is that you will also be getting items not served on the regular menu. As for the coconut rice everyone raved about, it was THAT good and a bag of chips.  We added another order of it even though the seams on our pants were ripping.  It can be eaten as is, and since most of the items at P&K were fried, it helped to balance out our palettes. Two thumbs WAY up on this one. I'll be back.
13814	71	4.0	1	2013-06-23	I don't know if I would consider myself a foodie, but I am pretty adventurous with food. As a result, at this point, I don't really come across surprising ingredient and flavor combinations. Well, I did at Pig and Khao. My dining companion and I ordered the mango salad, pork jowls and coconut rice. In my opinion, this is fusion well done. The dishes were really inventive, tasty and refreshing. I particularly liked the pork jowls -- would have never thought to combine watermelon, pork and chicharones. It worked though! We also tried both of the deserts. I didn't love the halo halo, but I think it's an acquired taste. The banana desert was crazy delicious though. The fritter was perfectly crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside and awesomely balanced by the salted caramel ice-cream. Service was great too. Our waiter was lovely.
13815	71	4.0	1	2013-06-21	Went with a group of friends to catch up.  Fantastic food fusion Thai, Vietnamese, Philipino.  So we ordered a little of everything on the menu and there was nothing I wouldn't recommend.  The food is fabulous from the appetizers to the desserts (and I don't typically enjoy cooked banana).  The staff were very friendly and helpful the kitchen is small so they like you to order everything together.  The reason I gave it  4 rather than 5 stars was because from the moment I sat down I felt a pressure to hurry, eat and leave.  I mean they were giving us our cheque before we had finished dessert.  It just didn't make for a relaxing evening.  The outdoor area by the way is lovely however you can't book so make sure you get there early.  Would definitely go back and give it a second go but I don't like to be rushed I like to relax and take my time.
13816	71	4.0	1	2013-06-19	Enjoyed everything we had...will def. be returning!
13817	71	4.0	1	2013-06-19	"I had a great experience at Pig and Khao from the ambiance to the food and I've been meaning to come back ever since. The inside of the restaurant itself is tiny and you're definitely seated at an intimate distance from other diners but there is a decent sized outdoor/garden area in the back. My gf and I ordered the crispy red curry rice salad, sizzling sigsig, mussels and a bowl of coconut rice. It was definitely enough to fill and satisfy both of us. Although the portion sizes were not the norm of regular American establishments, let's be honest, that's why we're all fat so maybe it's a good thing the portion sizes were ""smaller"" or normal outside of the US haha. Crispy Red Curry Rice Salad - I loved the flavors of the dish. The saltiness and spiciness of the red curry brittle/pieces combined with the sour/tart of the lime tied together with the taste of the coriander. It was definitely an unexpected first bite and I loved how the flavors developed and complimented each other. My only complaint about this dish would be that there was a bit too much of the red curry bits which at certain times overwhelmed and detracted from the other flavors of the dish. Mussels - I'm indifferent when it comes to seafood so my opinion might be biased. I thought it was a decent dish but nothing out of the ordinary that you can't find at any other restaurant that serves mussels cooked in a broth. The fried mantao was a nice touch. Sizzling Sigsig - This dish was my favorite. It tasted so good and wasn't as spicy as I thought it'd be. I was expecting to see some pig head on a platter that we pick off of but it was already ""deboned"" for us so all the hard work was done. Added some lime to it and it was good to go. It was seasoned well and the lime added a nice touch to it. I do recommend pairing it with a bowl of the coconut rice as the sweetness of the coconut complimented well with the saltiness of the sigsig."
13818	71	2.0	1	2013-06-17	The sisig was the best part of our dinner. unfortunately that was also the ONLY good part of our dinner. Their small plates = baby sized portions (literally you will walk out of here still hungry), UNLESS you drop an arm and a leg for AT LEAST 2-3 small plates per person.  This restaurant can be summed up as follows: mediocre tasting food, tiny portions, overpriced (even for a manhattan establishment). I dont mind being ripped off, but at least fill me belly with some scrumptious grub and non-Gerber sized food. The price to food portion ratio here is ridiculous.
13819	71	4.0	1	2013-06-14	Delicious! Comfy, adorable backyard seating, fantastic waiter, warm welcome.  We loved the Chinese sausage salad (but really spicy!), the whole fried fish and the pork belly adobo was my favorite. With a side of cocomut rice - YUM!
12652	71	3.0	1	2013-06-13	"Popular dish ""Sizzling Sisig"" $12 Crispy Pork  Yum"
13820	71	4.0	1	2013-06-12	meet the meatier cousin of Fatty Crab. a nice addtion to the modern south-east-asia food scene. cute space, and great location. the menu is very pork heavy so even if you are a fan of her piggly wiggly-ness like moi, you WILL be porked out at the end of the meal. dishes to try: Sisig-very nice interpretation, bridging the traditional with the modern. pork jowl- very awesome jowl...super tender and juicy, great sauce but the watermelon was a big clunky mussels- tasty sauce, loved the fried man tao to dip with..wished the mussels were not over cooked. crispy pata-foie gras sauce was amazing, great texture to the pata...A BIG dish for two so bring a friend Service was attentive and friendly As for the over all rating...if it was a choice between going to Fatty Crab or Pig and Khao for dinner, I would still pick Fatty Crab with out a hint of hesitation.
13821	71	5.0	1	2013-06-11	Let me start this off by saying that I am a HUGE top chef fan and was super excited that Leah Cohen has a restaurant in NYC! I love the Filipino fusion food offered at this restaurant, but what I love even more is how the almighty pig is showcased. Here's what we ordered: chicharron, chickpeas, pork jowl, sizzling sisig, Khao soi, and coconut rice. The pork jowl with watermelon was just amazing. The sisig was crispy delicious pieces from the various parts of a pig head served with a very runny but luxurious egg. When mixed together, the egg and pork fat coated the pork pieces like a perfectly crafted sauce. Although it wasn't a pork dish, the red curry sauce in the Khao soi was good enough to drink. If my husband were writing this review, he would go on and on about the coconut rice. It was the perfect compliment to all of the dishes. I am very much planning to revisit and will order the bottomless self serve beer next time! Thanks to Top Chef Leah for creating a memorable meal and experience!
13822	71	5.0	1	2013-06-11	Great food and not expensive...
13823	71	4.0	1	2013-06-10	Had a good experience at Pig and Khao for dinner. The weather was beautiful so we sat outside (in the back). The atmosphere is lovely, especially in the outdoor seating area. The food is definitely on the more creative side, and very heavy on the pork. That said, we really enjoyed everything we ate and there is definitely something on the menu even for picky eaters (one of whom I was dining with...). Ordered the mussels, the sirloin and the Khao Soi. Everything was really delicious and the portion size was excellent. Thought the prices were fairly reasonable for the quality of the food. Dessert was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. Ordered the Turon (fried bananas with caramel ice cream and chocolate sauce). The ice cream was very good, fried bananas pretty flavorless and the chocolate seemed very out of place and tasted far too salty. Definitely will return since it's in the neighborhood! Recommended for anyone looking for a delicious meal and nice atmosphere plus something a little different.
13824	71	4.0	1	2013-06-07	Modern Fusion Filipino Food.  Delicious! Chicharron, Chinese Sausage Salad, Grilled Pork Jowl, and Sizzling Sisig were amongst the dishes ordered.  My fave of the night - Sizzling Sisig - Pork Head, Chili, and Whole Egg.  YUM.  Pork Slap Pale Ale to accompany the meal.  No complaints from this foodie!  Pic - yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-…
13319	71	2.0	1	2013-06-07	I have to be honest I love any Asian fusion and I had high high hopes for pork heavy Pig and Khao.  First it is way over priced for medium tasty food- the chicharon were just fried airy pork skins, the pork jowl (very mushy and a much better version is served at Fatty Cue) and the bib lettuce salad was just vinegary/chili messes and the stand out dish of the night, the pork belly adobo came with a refrigerator cold egg (the egg is supposed to be warm.) My other favorite was the delicious tiny dish of penuts- honestly the best thing of the night.  This place has a nice downtown trendy vibe but was very loud-  there are much better in the City if you want something trendy or hike out to Queens to get much better tasty Asian food for far less $!
13825	71	4.0	1	2013-06-05	Sizzling Sisig: Must have! Will order this one again and again. Watermelon and Pork Jowl salad: fresh taste for summer! Garlic Rice is great, but if you order sizzling sisig, plain rice would be the best.
7251	71	2.0	1	2013-06-05	Brought a friend here for her birthday. Was really excited because of the good reviews & high stars. Plus filipino food is yummy. What a huge disappointment. I can't believe people actually gave 5 stars? That is meant for restaurants with PERFECT everything.  Not sure if it's because I came on a Tuesday and the head chef wasn't there. Just a bunch of Mexicans cooking supposedly authentic filipino food. FOOD: Pork rinds had too much pepper. I choked a bit from it. The pork adobo was decent. Had the curry salad. Nothing special.  Didnt like how the burnt pieces stick to your teeth. The sizzling sisig (pig head) was what I was excited about. Very fatty, and tasted like the pork rinds,  curry salad, & pork adobo. Granted they are all pork, but the chef can't come up with different flavors and spices for the different dishes??? I thought that was ridiculous. Finally we had the halohalo dessert. Very bland, mostly just eating ice with no flavor. Oh yea and the coconut rice everyone is talking about.  It's just OK. The fried fish came with soup. Thought the soup tasted weird. The fish was decent. 3 people eating.  We paid for the birthday girl. Came out to $60 pp. And yea, no drinks were ordered. I gave 2 stars because service was good. Even though they sat us in the back where there is a huge AC meant for the cooks to stay cool. But for guests just sitting and eating, we freezed & shivered in the month of JUNE! Go somewhere else. Kuma or Mahalrika
13826	71	3.0	1	2013-06-03	Came here cuz I was craving sisig:  Too much chewy (a lot of ear), not enough crunchy.
13827	71	5.0	1	2013-06-03	I read a lot about Pig & Khao on all of the food blogs, so I was looking forward to trying it for quite a while. I'm a huge fan of the Top Chef series, so I was curious to taste Leah Cohen's food. It did not disappoint! The restaurant is very small and intimate, with Asian-inspired modern decor.  It's an open kitchen, and guests sitting at the bar counter in front of the kitchen can watch the chefs in action. I was wowed at the speed and efficiency of what was going on behind the stove.  It was a show in itself, and if you go at the right time, you'll get to sit at the bar while Leah is cooking.  It made me appreciate the food I was eating even more. Anyway, on to the food.  I came here for a late dinner, and after a 30-45 minute wait we tried the grilled pork jowl, grilled sirloin (had a very spicy dipping sauce), and Sizzling Sisig. Everything was good, but did not compare to the Sizzling Sisig, which stole the show away.  Served on a sizzling caste iron plate that cooks the egg as it's brought out to you, this dish was AMAZING.  You break the egg yolk and it mixes with the pork meat, and it's a party in your mouth.  I still dream about this dish, and it's reason enough for me to return.  I also got the Phucket Punch cocktail, which was excellently made. I was so obsessed with my meal at Pig & Khao that I came back the very next morning for brunch.  This time we were seated at the bar and were lucky enough to come while Leah was working the kitchen.  I ended up getting the bottomless mimosas, which certainly did the job for me.  There are 4 different flavors, and after trying 3 of them, I decided my favorite was the lychee.  We got the steak and eggs (which is the same as the grilled sirloin from dinner) and as tempted as I was to get the Sizzling Sisig again, I wanted to try something new.  I ordered the Bahn Xeo, which was delicious.  It's a crispy fried crepe filled with shrimp, bacon, and greens.  Kind of like a crispy taco, but bigger and messier (and yummier, in my opinion).  I have to say, it was a bit more expensive than my usual brunch, but a very nice treat that left me extremely satisfied. Pig & Khao has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in NYC, and I also love that Leah Cohen seems really cool and down to earth.  She gets extra points in my book for actually working in her own restaurant instead of just putting her name on it for publicity and walking away, like so many up-and-coming chefs do.  I'm around the Clinton/Rivington area a lot, and I've seen her hanging around the restaurant quite a bit.  I just hope that she always stays as involved as she seems to be now, because I'll always be excited to return and hope that I'll catch her in the kitchen again.
13828	71	4.0	1	2013-06-01	I'm a huge fan of fusion restaurants and was thrilled to discover Pig and Khao! Thai and Filipino fusion, how could you pass that up? I'd prefer authentic and traditional Filipino food, but that doesn't take away from Pig and Khao's unique take on some my favorite Filipino dishes. Just an FYI, the portions are pretty small here, similar to portions at a tapas bar. Here's how I rate their food: Sizzling Sisig - 4/5 Quail Adobo - 4/5 Crispy Pata - 3/5 Halo Halo - 2/5 Unfortunately, my least favorite entree ended being the most expensive ($26) item on the bill. Also, the halo halo was very disappointing and way too icy.
13829	71	5.0	1	2013-06-01	OMG! Del-I-Cious! We went here with a small group and got everything on the menu. Each dish was better then last, which is hard to pull especially when you arrive hungry and leave stuffed. Great friendly service.
13830	71	1.0	1	2013-05-30	This is not the level of food we are used to get by this restaurant group! So following a 2 star review by Pete Wells of the New York times and the fact that my wife and i are long time fatty cue customers, we went for dinner 2 weeks ago.First thing , there is no point going to places which receive 2 stars by Pete Wells. If this is the standard for 2 stars, we need to seek out the 3-4 starred establishments in the New york times. The service: hipster d-bag style. our server, did not know the menu items, did not make eye contact and was generally displeased with his job , so much that when his shift was over we simply began getting service from someone else. the food: beneath mediocre. i have had better Filipino take out. This place is all attitude , without the quality to justify it! No chef on the line, cooks texting on the line and showing each other pics... My sizzling sisig had so much kafir lime in it that it tasted like soap. watermelon salad with cheap store bought cracklings, the rest of the food ( 3 other dishes all tasted the same: fish sauce and lime and that's it. Not sure if we should return to the other restaurants this group runs. We will never return to Pig and Khao though.
13831	71	3.0	1	2013-05-29	as the weather gets nicer, get ready to wait. when we went the wait was approximately 2 hours. luckily it's the LES so bars aplenty to while away the time while you wait for your reservation. Pig & Khao takes your number down so that they can text you when your table's ready which is convenient. approximately 1.5 hours later, we got the text from the restaurant and headed over. cute setting, very small neighborhood restaurant with a nice backyard outdoor seating area. low lighting gives it the potential for a reasonable date setting or just cool hipsters talking about fusion foods. overall i found the food very good. i liked everything we ordered and was satisfied with the flavors and presentation. that being said, the prices are a little steep for the amount of food you receive.  being asian, i find it a little ridiculous the prices vs. portions being served in comparison to the more authentic (albeit less trendy) filipino restaurants in the outer boroughs. we started with an order of the Grilled Pork Jowl. the watermelon was sweet and refreshing which contrasted with the salty-tangy fish sauce. the crispy chicharron also added a great texture to the dish. we also ordered the Quail Adobo. this dish i could've done without. the quail was crispy and the flavor was good, but nothing stood out. and, as is the case with quail, the pieces were tiny. our final small plate was the Sizzling Sisig. this dish looks pretty impressive when it arrives at your table. and it is pretty good. but is it blow me away good? not particularly.  however, portion-wise, it's probably the best bang for your buck. since we were eating family-style, we also ordered one large plate to share: Whole Fried Fish. this was probably my favorite dish of the night. and while i agree that the price is a little more than what i would pay at a chinese restaurant for a much larger steamed whole fish, the flavors in the broth were so poignant that i forgave the smaller portion. i highly recommend ordering this dish if you like the sweet and sour flavor that is often associated with southeast asian foods. additionally, you must make sure to order a bowl of their Coconut Rice.  it is delicious. eaten on its own you can really taste the sweetness that coconut milk adds to the rice. when paired with the other dishes, which all tend to lean towards the sour/salty flavor spectrum, it is a perfect complement. i would come back to Pig & Khao. the food was good and the atmosphere was friendly (as opposed to frenetic-which can happen at a lot of hyped-up small trendy restaurants). yes, it's a little pricier than what i would usually pay for similar food. but when it's good, it's good. and to be smack-dab in the center of the LES isn't a bad place to be after a great meal or, in reverse order, after a bunch of drinks and on the hunt for food.
13832	71	4.0	1	2013-05-22	3 for food + 1 for atmosphere, service, vibe.  Is that a word people still use?  This place has good energy.  Energy is worse than vibe.  Anyway!  After recent experiences at downtowns' ascending Filipino establishments, will say this is my favorite but that in general I find the cuisine not totally appealing, so I'll stick to talking about the positive atmosphere, the very friendly service, the semi-celebrity chef still in the kitchen actually cooking each night, the top notch michelada.  Also I liked the cod a lot.
12516	71	4.0	1	2013-05-22	This is purely a brunch review: I'm feeling the music, the $15 all you can drink mimosas, which are tasty and available in 3 various flavors (lychee, orange, and watermelon) and the outdoor seating.  It terms of environment, it gets quite warm in the restaurant with the open kitchen, especially by the bar area (tip: layers my friend). for food we shared the sizziling sisig, delicious melt in your mouth pork fat, with a side of garlic rice (yes your breath will be kicking) and the longonissa sausage, which was just alright. I'd come back for dinner.
13833	71	4.0	1	2013-05-19	Love their crispy pata and sizzling sisig.
7636	71	5.0	1	2013-05-19	Holy shit! A good ass Filipino fusion place that isn't fake or in Queens! A sisig place where you can eat it with coconut rice. It cain't git no better. It's all that I get when I come here and my cravings for sisig come way too often than I'd like. The halo-halo is money too. The fact that they play hip hop while I eat my food is just the icing on the cake. I will say that this place is perfect for sisig, but don't come here expecting a full out Filipino food place complete with Kare Kare, barbecue, Bicol Express or anything like that. You go to Queens or Grill 21 for that type of shit.
13834	71	4.0	1	2013-05-16	Pig and Whao!  big fan
13835	71	5.0	1	2013-05-15	This little piggy ate a pig.  A sisig pig.  I brought my LA friend here without knowing she doesn't eat much pig.  And then I force fed her some pig head.  For any people with friends who are unwilling to try new types of foods, exotic and foreign to them, just don't tell them what they're eating.  They won't be able to tell what it is when it arrives anyway.  Just scoop some onto their plate and let their minds be blown.  Don't do this if they follow any religions which restrict their diets.  They will be really angry with you.  And might 'Pork Slap' you. In fact, try the tasting menu- it's about $35/pp and you get 5 or 6 dishes served.  You won't know in advance what you'll get, but you can request a couple of must-haves to be included and they will cater to you.  What's good is that you will also be getting items not served on the regular menu. No risk, no reward.  But we did get two dishes that I wasn't particularly fond of; one was the halo-halo(one ingredient had a meaty taste and texture) and the other was the mango/papaya salad(bit too tart) that came with chicken. As for the coconut rice everyone raved about, it was THAT good and then some.  We added another order of it even though the seams on our pants were ripping.  It can be eaten as is, and since most of the items at P&K were fried, it helped to balance out our palettes.
13836	71	4.0	1	2013-05-13	Attention! If you are from the South, don't like that 'rap music', and are generally not fond of trying new things - avoid Pig and Khao like it's the atheist's gay pride abortion parade. Pig and Khao embodies New York's casual dining scene right now, which, depending on your attitude to New York, you will either love or loathe. It's a smallish place that still feels airy thanks to the high ceiling, features a back patio for the warmer months, and a mixture of Golden Age and new school hip hop for your soundtrack. The Filipino inspired dishes meanwhile, boast some rather unique flavor combinations such as grilled pork jowl with watermelon, chicharron, toasted rice, lime-chili fish sauce & herbs, and some items that don't sound appetizing at all (sizzling sizig: pork head, chili, whole egg), or the Filipino donuts we had for dessert that come with what looks like a pastel green slime sauce (but turns out to be some kind of custard). All are in fact, extremely delicious, especially when combined with the coconut rice. Pig and Khao rocks - go there!
13837	71	5.0	1	2013-05-13	We had a great time at Pig and Khao! Great service &food! Can't wait to go back!
13838	71	4.0	1	2013-05-12	Pork, pork, and pork seems to be the main  theme of this place. Pork and bottomless mimosas! My friend and I came here for Saturday brunch and the place was packed. We ordered the sizzling sizing, which consisted of small pieces of pork served on a sizzling platter with egg and lime. We also had the grilled pork jowl, which is basically salad made up of pork, watermelon and toasted rice crisp pieces. Sounds strange? Yes, but surprisingly refreshing. The $15 bottomless mimosas was quite a deal if you intend to have at least two because you can sample a variety of flavors-- from the classic orange to more exotic flavors like lychee, watermelon, and mango.
13839	71	3.0	1	2013-05-06	3.5 stars. this place is solid - the flavors are great, portions/prices are good (except for the market vegetables...$7 for a small plate of salty chinese broccoli?!) and service was attentive. the sizzling sisig (pork head) was cooked well and went really nicely with the fried egg. the red curry was packed with flavor and was pretty spicy - a little too heavy for my taste but delicious nonetheless. the coconut rice is off da hooookkk...perfect flavor and texture!!! yummmm. overall, a great place to try once but i'm not necessarily itching to return
13840	71	1.0	1	2013-05-02	"5/2 8:49pm My husband and I had drinks and dinner. I got the fried oyster special and I got a nice sharp piece of shell in my crispy batter.  The manager, a heavy set white guy, asked how the oysters were and I thumbs downed as tried to get the shell out of my mouth.  I said they're delicious but they've got to be more careful.  Here's a shell.  I tapped it on the plate so he could hear it was a hard piece of shell.  He said, ""If you find another I'll get you another plate.""  So on my last oyster I find another shell piece.  He's there.  I pointed it out and said there it is.  And his response was to look at it and then give  the 1000 yard stare over left shoulder. They asked us if we wanted desert and since I didn't feel like carefully, trepidatiously chewing any more food that could break my teeth or choke me to death we declined. Honestly, it was the attitude of the manager that earned it the 1 star.   I hope the owner reads this.   This place is pretty pricey but I wouldn't mind if the food wasn't dangerous and management lazy about it. OH!  And when they handed us the check, they gave us a comment card.  It was a little late for that.  I was already mentally composing my Yelp review."
13841	71	4.0	1	2013-04-28	Made a reservation online, and was able to have the entire backyard patio to ourselves on a chilly evening.  My husband and I went with the chef's six course selection, which was totally worth every penny.  (I think it was only like $30 per person).  Very interesting flavors, lots of fresh seafood, and delicious dessert.
13842	71	5.0	1	2013-04-28	Came here for brunch this morning/early this afternoon and loved every part of the experience. Sat in the backyard courtyard area and partook of many a mango mimosa thanks to their $15 bottomless mimosa special. Corn beef hash was absolutely delicious. I will definitely be back in the months ahead. So delicious, so friendly, so chill.
13843	71	5.0	1	2013-04-28	Love, love, LOVE! So, I didn't do what normal people do...get a reservation. I'm glad I didn't. I can here right after work one day...I had a groupon, not that I needed on to entice me to come here in the first place. Being that I didn't have a reservation and I came right after work, I got to sit at the bar with my friend. Happy hour drink specials...$1 draft PBR, not too bad...we had about 3 each. I totally loved sitting at the bar, it was the bar in front of their open kitchen. I was enthralled by watching them putting all the food together. And everything just looked ridiculously delicious. The service is great. They are very attentive. Foodwise, we ordered the following things: Sizzling Sisig - this dish is awesome, there's a reason why it's so popular and it's not just because it's a pig's head, be sure to squeeze the lime on it for added flavors. The meat is delicious and moist and cut into bite-size pieces. The egg fries while the plate is in front of you. though I don't add cilantro, it goes amazingly well with this dish. Eat it with some rice...just because, but it's not needed...it just helps to savor the flavor and last longer (enough for two people if you're not too hungry)...though it looks kind of small Crispy Pata - this was a huge dish, but oh-so-delicious. if you're thai-ish like me, then sprinkle some of the dried crush pepper onto your pickled mango salad and it'll taste just like home. the pork is delicious moist and the skin its ridiculous, awesomely crispy and crunchy, you just can't pass it up Market Greens - these were awesome. the perfect thing to balance our our meal Regular white rice - helps when you're eating so much pork You MUST check this place out. It's awesome...and delicious...and oh-so-good!
13844	71	3.0	1	2013-04-26	"I was searching for Flip food and places where they sell halo halo. Pig and Khao came up with their cute curly tailed signage and what a winning name. I figured since it was in my old hood I could have dinner with the family there. I got myself a rezzo on their online reservation system. Got ready with a coupon in my pocket to check out this place. I was prompt because I wanted to hold our reservation for such a large party and at first glance it is kind of a small place. The bar was actually in the front window area. There is a bench by the door for people waiting. I didn't realize they also have seating in the back garden area. The music was pumping on a Thursday night, not earsplitting level but definitely needed to be turned down a notch as the noise became cumbersome. We needed to play telephone all night shouting and passing along the conversation from 1 person to the next because we couldn't hear each other. I guess you can escape the loud music if you sit in the back garden. We were seated by the guy at the host table in the front who also turned out to be our waiter. He had a nice smile and reminds me of the werewolf guy Alcide from True Blood if he were to wear trucker hats. He seated us right away and was attentive the whole night checking on us. Since we had a big party we got to try a bunch of dishes. I had the sweet & sour cilantro soda which tasted like the vegan man's version of a virgin mojito. The cute Hitachino Nest beer is..warning...priced high but served in ceramic bowls. Cheaper options are the $1 happy hour PBRs or the all you can drink HH or Genesee Cream Ale or get sangria. If you get the coconut drink its served street style- they cut the top off a coconut and put a straw in it. We started off with the chicharrones  because when you think of pig you think of chicharrones which were served in a small bowl with some white wine vinegar for dipping. Crispy and crunchy enough like those pork rinds that come in a bag from the bodega but small portion. Since it was dinner time they said they didn't have the garlic rice which I don't understand. I was looking forward to it because I like garlic so much that I can never be a vampire. Couldn't figure out why they couldn't make it. We had the jasmine rice and the coconut rice instead and they give you a pretty big bowl of rice. 1 bowl is enough to share for 2 people. The ""small plates"" we had were the sizzling sisig pork head with the raw egg cracked over the top. You are supposed to mix it and squeeze the lime over it. It had a nice smoky flavor and very chewy. If you don't like trying adventurous stuff and only eat the safe parts of the pig don't get this because it can be chewy in a weird way but I enjoyed the flavor. Not sure if it would fill me up if this was the only thing I ordered. I would suggest getting additional items or fill up on the rice. One of our party has a dietary restriction and just ordered one of the salads which turned out to be some grated veggies with some chicken over the top it was kind of like a half portion and it had a cloudy sauce that I thought was lemon juice but she said it was mango and she didn't really end up finishing it. The khao soi was the best dish in this category. It is a pretty good size bowl of noodles served in a big chinese soup bowl you get from the supermarket. It came with a curry sauce that had good thickness and I really like the crispy noodles (they are the type they serve with your egg drop soup from the takeout restaurants) scattered atop the egg noodles that hold the curry sauce quite nicely. The entree dishes we got were my favorite which may explain the huge price point difference of at least an additional $10 for the same size dish. We got the crispy pata which is the pork leg that is fried and really tasty and came with a soy sauce and a liver dipping sauce. I ran out of rice by this time since they brought out the dishes one at a time but it was still good and I was fighting the others for pieces of the crisped skin and pork. I dipped first in the soy and then in the liver sauce. We also got the bbq ribs they were not mind blowing but I enjoyed how the meat on the rib was very tender and it had a dark smoky kind of flavor. I would count it as a half rack. For dessert we had the halo halo of course and the fried banana fritters. The halo halo was also served in the chinese soup bowl filled with shaved ice mixed with condensed milk, one scoop of purple yam ice cream and a ton of slivered almonds and maybe some small pieces of flan but I couldn't tell because there were so many almonds and also small julliened strings of jellied coconut that you have to dive for in the shaved ice milk puddle.  Not as many items as a traditional halo halo though I did like it you could possibly split this with 4 people if you like sharing. Banana fritters were ehh tho it had caramel ice cream. I wouldn't consider this ""authentic"" food and kinda pricey but I may return if I had another coupon."
13845	71	5.0	1	2013-04-26	"I have been here twice and absolutely LOOVE it! Filipino cuisine and culture (aside from balut) ,rarely gets  front stage recognition compared to other asian food, especially in manhattan. Primarily, Filipino restaurants are small mom and pops restaurants owned and managed by filipino immigrants typically, and the customer base are 99% filipino in a filipino community such as Queens. Pig and Khao on the other hand,  takes pride in filipino food  and culture and brings it to a whole new level so that it appeals to various palettes (traditional filipino, yet cool and contemporary) . The ambiance is hip, jovial without trying too hard. Eating in the garden reminds me of being at someone's filipino house (minus the pig spit ;)  (although I wish they played music in the garden area too) and casually eating and laughing the night away!! I LOOVE any of the pork dishes, coconut rice and chicharron and vinegar sauce! As a Filipina myself, the food , the garden in the back, the aroma of rice and filipino seasonings make me an official regular!  it is wonderful to see filipino culture exposed to rest of the world . The only negative: our server- brunette, long hair. She served us both times we were there and unfortunately doesn't have the hospitality and generosity that one naturally gets where delicious filipino food is served. She didnt come to check on us enough, forgot the wine specials, and when I said, we may order some more dishes later, she replied ""the chef prefers you order everything all at once."" boo. she sucked. The food is so good though, I am going back. p.s. there is a cute  little black cat that roams around in the patio from time to time, which I love. It reminds me of the cats that wander around  restaurant outdoor seating areas in europe and asia."
13846	71	4.0	1	2013-04-26	"My reaction to the first bite was ""THIS IS NONSENSE!"" The presentation and equisite blend of flavors were nothing short of ridiculous to me. I was not prepared. I was there for a business dinner and I honestly felt like the food was so POW that it was so distracting. The scents of all the dishes--even at nearby tables--stopped conversation a few times. They had a 5-course tasting menu, but I wasn't prepared for that so had a chicken dish in a coconut broth that was ah-mazing. It was then even more thrilling with a sweet coconut rice--that felt like I had dessert with dinner!  Seeing others get the tasting menu, seeing their reactions, I probably missed out big time. They also had an ""all you can drink"" beer special--wasn't prepared for that, either.   Despite the fact that I don't eat pork and virtually everything on the menu is pork, I would go back again. Pretty outstanding. Lost a star for two reasons that some people may not care about: 1) I don't eat pork so I felt limited-as if there were only a couple options for me. My impression -- based on what I saw on the menu only. I'm sure others can work around it. 2) We sat outside and there was a cat climbing around on the walls and this was distracting. It was not at our feet begging for food, but it was a very animated animal and it was obvious that it was not new to the backyard. Let me be very clear -- this was not a stray cat and not harassing in any way. I would still go back and sit in the outdoor patio area--and I'm not fond of animals."
13847	71	4.0	1	2013-04-26	Pig and Khao, such an interesting place! Smells delicious, good music, open (tiny) kitchen, tight seating arrangements so get ready to cuddle with your neighbors, and a back patio that will be amazing when it finally gets warm in NYC. Things started off really well but by the end of the night they barely held on to this 4 star review and i would say it's a low 4. Here's the rundown. What we ate (in order of our favorite to least favorite): grilled pork jowl with watermelon - a little spicy, refreshing, tender pork, delicious chinese sausage salad - also spicy, refreshing, delicious coconut rice - yum!! sweet and a perfect pairing to all the spicy things we had khao soi - a better version than what we hand in Chang Rai northern thailand. also a large portion and very filling with all the noodles. the chicken in this was a little dubious. i avoided. sauteed bok choy - the veggie of the day, my bf insisted on it. had nice flavor but i could have done without. sizzingling sisig - gets rave reviews (from yelp and my friends who visited before) but we flat out did not like. we found the dish very fatty and greasy with the majority of the meat pieces full of gristle or all fat. the flavor was very unappealing to me. we barely touched this and when our server came to take it away she didnt bother to ask why. now on to the service. while we enjoyed most of the food the service is where they almost lost another star. they were completely unorganized. hard to track down. took far too long to take our order and then far too long between each of the dishes above. we were averaging a 10 minute wait in between each which was pretty awkward. didnt ask how we liked anything. we had to ask for another round of beer. just overall not very good with the exception of the guy who kept our water glasses full the whole night so props to him. overall good experience and cranking out some good food. they just need to up their service standard and meal pacing and they'll be a legit spot in my book.
13848	71	4.0	1	2013-04-25	Really inventive flavours, good food and a very relaxed vibe make this a great place for a low key dinner.
13849	71	3.0	1	2013-04-25	My husband and I went here for dinner on a weeknight. We didn't have a reservation so we ended up sitting on the chef's bar area. We watched the chef's make all the dishes for the restaurant so it was pretty entertaining. The chef and staff were very clean. For appetizer we orders pork rinds and sisig, for entrée we had BBQ ribs and crispy pata with a side of coconut rice. The pork rinds came out right away which they should have since they tasted like they came out of a bag I could have purchased at a bodega lol. The ribs came out next - they were ok and had an overwhelming taste of fish sauce. Next came the crispy pata which was very tasty. I've had crispy pata all my life and this was one of the best ones I've ever had. It came with papaya coleslaw which is traditionally served with this dish. The sisig came out last. The waitress forgot but it's ok since she was nice. The sisig was a bit overdone and it didn't have the bite a traditional sisig should have (I was looking for a crunchy/chewing texture). We were too stuffed to have dessert there so I asked for halo-halo to go. Since we were sitting at the chef's table we heard the chef yell at the waitress about not encouraging to-go orders since they don't have plastic utensils. I had the halo-halo the next day (out of my freezer) and it was delicious.
13850	71	3.0	1	2013-04-25	Had a quick meal here the other night.. They have dollar PBR's for happy hour and regularly, they have an all you can drink self service tap of PBR for 15 bucks.  The restaurant is tiny and LES Chic.  It was pretty comfortable.   We ordered the fermented vegetables, the sizzling sigsig w/ coconut rice and the Red Curry Rice Salad.   The fermented vegetables were very nice, mostly cabbage. They had the bubbly texture that only comes with a proper fermentation.  I enjoyed this.   The crispy rice salad was also very nice.  Little pieces of pork, some nuts, crunchy rice w/ the back note of the red curry.. They gave us lettuce to twist up the salad in.  A winner for sure.  Reminiscent of Lotus' Crispy Rice.   The sigsig was a big disappointment and made us not order anything else on the menu.  The flavor was there but, texture wise, it was off.  Soggy bits of uncrunchy pig head.  A very important component of this dish is the crispness of the bits of head.  These were just fatty little soft pieces.   I wanted to order more things but, the sigsig turned me off.  I will come back to try more things, though, I may be hard not to go to Kuma Inn instead.
13851	71	3.0	1	2013-04-24	Food was good but pricey. Portions were small. Service was lacking. We ordered coconut rice , chickpea, sisig, and crispy red curry salad. Coconut rice was A+. one of the best I've had. I think its even better than sripraphai's Sisig was good with the rice. texture of pig head is not for every1. Crispy salad also very good. Chickpeas... I have no idea why any 1 would eat that. It was dry hard and just hard to eat. Service was slow. . place was packed and had to request several times for our rice to come while our food was sitting at the table. I tried this place out with a google offer. Food was good. I cannot justify coming here and paying 12-14 bucs for a small plate.
13852	71	5.0	1	2013-04-23	So, if you read my earlier review, you know I had very high expectations coming into there tonight.  It was one of the most interesting meals I've had in my last year.  Happily, the folks cooking behind the bar did not disappoint.   I started with the fried oysters which were awesome, just the right amount of spice, thai chilis I think.  The second course was a Hue Meatball sandwich, ground beef and pork, scallions, Sirachi sauce, Hoison sauce and a bunch of other tasty morsels.  I would have been happy just ordering these.  The third course was the only one that wasn't awesome, but it was certainly tasty, some kind of egg and fried rice squares...  Fourth course was back to perfection.  Mussels in a fish broth, butter sauce with some kind of sausage bits and these small amazing bread things (think of a dense Beignet without the sugar) - by this time I am beyond stuffed and the tasting menu is not over yet.  Finally came a wonderful steak and the Coconut rice.  This time I was smart though and asked for it to go.  Of course, I had to have a few bites first and the rice was as good as last time.  Looking forward to lunch tomorrow.  Again, HUGE recommendation and remember to sit at the bar and watch them cook, it is really cool.
13853	71	3.0	1	2013-04-22	So I've finally tried the food here.  And my 2 stars barely gets upgraded to 3. The seating is somewhat awkward with bright lights right in your face and otherwise dark all over.  It makes the place not feel too cozy, even with the tables that are too small.  The music is all hiphop, mostly old skool 90's era and is too loud to manage a good conversation at your table.  If you order a beer that comes in a can they do not put it into a glass, which was not cool in my book.  The waitstaff is not entirely friendly, and pretty slow considering the traffic that comes through the door.  No wonder it takes forever to get seated.  The cooks on the other hand, are very friendly and will tell you how the dish should be eaten & enjoyed.   The food is pretty decent, but not amazing.  It's decently authentic in flavor, but not in price.  Most of the dishes are broiled & fried, where most of them were too well done and far too greasy.  The overall flavor though, was pretty fantastic.   What we ordered: - Spice Chickpeas:  Pretty boring.  Sort of like wasabi peas but all coriander & cumin, and fried too much to the point of being burnt, brittle and carbon-like.   - Quail Adobo:  I suppose I expected this to be like Chicken Adobo, but it's nothing like that.  It's just a whole quail, deep fried with a vinegar/cilantro/lime sauce.  No veggies, no rice, nothing else.  The quail was good, but a bit awkward to eat bc you had to use your hands like fried chicken and each piece was small (think frog legs small & bony).  The sauce was what made the dish -- it was completely out of this world amazing.   - Sizzling Sisig:  I don't get the hullabaloo about this.  It's fatty pork pieces with an egg on top.  No big deal, nothing to write home about.  Again, it was over-broiled/fried, too oily, with not enough flavor.   - Crispy Red Curry Rice Salad:  Good pick because it's relatively light and is a self-service lettuce-wrap dish.  But there were chunks of the red curry that were too crispy and (again) over-fried.   None of the food came with rice, which I think is ridiculous.  The coconut rice was very good -- it can easily be enjoyed on its own.  But the flavor wasn't strong enough to complement any of the other dishes which were oily and overpowering.  One rice can be shared between two people -- it's a decent sized bowl.  But if you're asian and love rice to down your greasy food, get your own bowl.   I would order the dishes in a tapas-style.  Each small dish is too small as an entree, but two dishes is too much for one person.  3 dishes between 2 people is good and you might have some leftovers for the next day. Conclusion:   Good flavor, but could be better.  Dishes are too fatty, too oily, and over-fried.  Rice costs an extra $3 and honestly should come with the dishes to offset all the unnecessary grease.
13854	71	5.0	1	2013-04-22	So beyond tasty! I've been wanting to go here for awhile and was not disappointed at all. Cocktails are tasty and the food is fantastic. We had the fried oyster special, the crispy red curry rice salad, the sizzling sisig (Pig head) and the short ribs. Everything was cooked to perfection! We left feeling full and extremely happy!
12844	71	3.0	1	2013-04-22	I would like to preface my review by saying that I think Pig and Khao is really more like a 3.5 star restaurant than one deserving of an average 3 stars.  Why am I not giving it 4 then, you ask.  Well, I just felt like my experience was not entirely consistent and had some low points.   The experience began by making a reservation through OpenTable several days in advance.  Even with 5 days notice, most of the times were completely booked, so I wound up settling for an 1:30.  As the day approached, I had called to see if there was an opening any earlier.  I managed to get Chef Leah Cohen on the line, who was very nice and apologetic for not having an earlier table.  I told her that I had enjoyed her food at Centro Vinoteca and would keep the 1:30, as I was anxious to try out her take on Thai and Filipino cuisine.   Upon our arrival, the place was packed, confirming that we were lucky to even receive the table that we did.  I have to say that the atmosphere created the perfect setting for the cuisine; the space was cozy and intimate with a direct view of the small kitchen that resembled something one might find in a studio apartment.  The aromatic smells of each dish permeated the dining room, so I was grateful for this peek into how everything was assembled.  The brightly painted walls and paper napkins reinforced the playfulness of the dishes, as well as the casual vibe they were striving for.   Our waiter was handsome and had a fresh, trendy style and relaxing air about him, almost as if he had just returned from a peaceful stay in the Hamptons.  We were debating on our libation of choice, but he firmly confirmed our choice of the Phuket Punch by saying it was his favorite on the menu.  I have to say that I was extremely thankful for this declaration, as it led me to one of the best cocktails I have had in a long time.  Look out, this might be a new obsession...The white wine class was filled with prosecco, a grapefruit-cinnamon syrup, a fresh mint leaf, and a shaving of grapefruit zest.  The large straw placed inside the glass took this spritzer from boring to lively by its sheer inclusion.  The cinnamon added a sweet kick to the acidic grapefruit component.  It was a perfectly balanced beverage, just right for a festive brunch.   When it came to the food, though, I sadly had mixed feelings.  The meal started with the highlight - The Sizzling Sissig.  The hot platter contained chunks of random bits of pig's head, including the ears.  The meat was fatty, but full of flavor.  Chili and cilantro were sprinkled on top of the head, and a whole egg had been cracked right in the center of the plate.  We broke the yolk and tossed everything together for a smoky, creamy dish of decadence.  Our side order of rice, topped with burnt garlic shavings, was a perfect accompaniment to the meat.  The Bahn Xeo came to the table next.  This sizzling crepe had sounded like one of the most unusual items on the menu, but turned out to be VERY greasy.  This wrap around pancake itself was not very flavorful.  However, it was stuffed with plump shrimp that were perfectly cooked, crunchy bean sprouts, gooey fish sauce, and supposedly bacon, though I barely detected it.  I would have gladly eaten out the inside like a salad, but the crepe part was unnecessary.  Lastly, the Khao Soi was decent and certainly grew on me as the meal progressed.  This large bowl of creamy red curry sauce contained very few pieces of chicken, pickled mustard greens, shallots, and egg noodles.  While half the noodles had moistened beneath the sauce, the other half were peeking out of the broth and had remained crispy.  After a good mixing, the crunchiness disappeared, and the entire portion of noodles became infused with the flavors of Thailand.  However, there was an undertone of pungent sourness in the broth that I could not place.  Perhaps it was from the pickling of the greens or maybe from excess cumin or lemongrass, but something was off-putting.  We decided to skip dessert, but I gladly had another glass of punch, ha! We left Pig & Khao satisfied and content, agreeing that we wound certainly return.  However, the prices and the grease factor were both a bit too high to make this a regular weekend destination.
11163	71	4.0	1	2013-04-21	"Fried deliciousness!  My friends and I ordered a bunch of items off the menu.  If we had more people, I think we might've ordered one of everything. We started off with the chicarron -  dipped it in the vinegar.  Crunch crunch, num num num.  I don't know if anyone can ever mess this up spiced chickpeas - nice flavor... more of a filler.  For the amount of food we ordered, we didn't need to get this dish. grilled pig jowl - so tender, so sweet, a definite must get.  Don't let the word ""jowl"" intimidate you.  Cheek meat is always super tender and has great flavor. quail adobo was so cute and tiny... just push aside the thoughts that it's a tiny bird.  The crunchiness and the tangy sweet sauce makes this dish well worth ordering. The mussels were seasoned really well and it was difficult not to drink the soup Crispy pata was crispy and crunchity.  Fried and pork, what a great combination. grilled curry lamb - pretty good but since I'm not the biggest fan of lamb so I only liked it so-so. Dessert wise - it was difficult not to compare the food to what we had in the Philippines.  The turon was good.  The halo-halo had good toppings.  The leche flan in the halo-halo was pretty good too. Definitely go there for the small plates!"
12512	71	2.0	1	2013-04-18	Not sure what all the hoopla is about. Had the sisig (signature dish) and a few others. Very greasy. Waiters looked like lost kids who accidentally wandered into a restaurant. Cute decor though.
13855	71	5.0	1	2013-04-17	One made up word to sum up my experience here: YUMYUMYUMYUM. Came here on a Wednesday evening at 6pm with a reservation. It was pretty empty but full by the time we left. We did the tasting menu, which was handy because we couldn't decide what to get. This place was really great. I'm going to break it down mathematically: Mango Salad Small Plate = delicious. Ribs = amazing. Pig Head thing with egg = You should order this, it's tasty even though the name and description are weird, and I never would have gotten this on my own so glad they tossed it into the tasting menu. Pork with Watermelon = Who knew this could work so well together? It does. Donuts + Green Leaf Slime Sauce for dessert = GIVE ME MORE NOW. I came here with no expectations and was more than pleasantly surprised. The food is flavorful, different, but really well composed. I can't wait to go back.
13856	71	2.0	1	2013-04-16	Thoroughly disappointed! At first, I was excited that the restaurant served Filipino cuisine as well as launched by a chef from Top Chef. Also, after enjoying authentic Filipino cuisine from the Philippines, I was craving a good fix here. However, the general lack luster experience combined with mediocre food did not win me over for its overpriced menu. Even if Pig and Khao's ambiance is suppose to be a casual experience, their staff did not know ANYTHING. We decided to order the 5 course tasting menu for a fix price. For one thing, our waitress, although courteous and nice, did not tend to us as frequently despite the lack of patrons at the place. FYI, we were there for an early dinner around 5-6pm and there was only another couple having dinner. Did I also mention how there were 3-5 staff members just aimlessly waiting around? Not cool. The next thing that disturbed our experience was that when we received each dish, the presenter, who was not our waitress, did not even try to explain what we were getting. (Even if he did try to explain, he was either on mute or he just explained the meat type.) I even asked for better elaboration on one of the dishes and whether if it was Filipino .The presenter did not know whether if it was a Filipino dish or what the dish was at all. HOW IS THIS A TASTING MENU EXPERIENCE IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING? I'm not even trying to be anal about our experience. I did not even try to make it a big deal during our dinner, but after thinking about our experience, I will not come here again. The second part is that even the dinnerware seemed like cheap $1 items you'd find in Chinatown. I don't have anything against cheap dinnerware, but if I'm paying for an ambiance and an experience at a place, I'd expect better utensils. Next time, I can just eat at Chinatown for authentic food at a lower price. Food was mediocre. It only got 2 stars because our food came out fresh and I liked the coconut rice.
13857	71	3.0	1	2013-04-13	"I was excited to try this place cuz it combines my 2 fave cuisines: Thai & Filipino. In a nutshell great flavors but overpriced for what u get. 3 of us went for brunch and ended up spending  $123 incl tax & tip & still left hungry. Surprised to see reviews saying people were so stuffed. Maybe I have try again for dinner & hopefully portions are bigger. The atmosphere was energetic, decor was cute and loved the hip hop classics played in the background Initially we ordered as individual entrees but when waiter told us everything was made to share and would come out as ready, we were expecting larger portions What we ate: Can't go wrong with bottomless mimosas for $15 which was the best bang for buck. Love that they have 4 flavors. I loved the lychee & watermelon mimosas. Best part of our brunch Quail adobo - never had quail before & I don't think I'll have it again. Such small amount of meat on this bird. Even if I ate the whole dish by myself, I don't think I would be satisfied. The sauce didn't have enough kick as I expected Pork jowl - the dish was good but so tiny. I was particularly disappointed to find this did not come with the ""toasted rice"" that I was expecting. Come to find out the toasted rice was actually that lil crunchy stuff sprinkled all over the dish. I did like the combo of chicharron, jowl, watermelon cilantro & fish sauce. It was just a lil too fatty Longanisa & egg - it wasn't any different than how one can make it at home. It did come with a nice cucumber tomato salad Garlic rice side- after finding out the jowl in fact didnt come w/rice, we ordered 2 sides. & the 2 sides of rice were actually too much for the food that we had. Which is unusual in any Asian restaurant. Normally u end up having to order more rice. It was lacking in garlic flavor. U tasted more soy sauce Donuts w/pandan sauce - tastes like funnel cake balls with icing. Good but I wouldn't order it again for $8 Overall cool place but I really think they need to give bigger portions. I'll give it one more chance and try the dinner menu."
13858	71	5.0	1	2013-04-11	I purchased a Google deal and came here for dinner.  The meal was fantastic.  The hostess was very nice and the atmosphere was very casual, hippie, and comfortable.  This is a great place to hang out with friends.  They also have a small outdoor area perfect for the summer time.  We ordered the 5 course menu for $39/pp.  First course-shrimp toast (I wish they were bigger than bite size.  It was so delish).  Second course-fried oysters with white pepper dipping sauce.  Third course- famous sizzling sisig (highly recommend).  Fourth course- mussels. Fifth course- spare ribs (which by this time we were so full).  And it comes with dessert too!  We were served fried buns with coconut jam.  Overall experience was phenomenal.  Definitely recommend this joint.  It's small so not for a party more than 6.
13859	71	5.0	1	2013-04-11	i came with a group and we ordered everything but the chinese sausage, large plate fish, and large plate pork leg.  i will be going back for the following: coconut rice, pork head, large plate ribs, crispy red curry rice salad, khao soi, and the quail. i will not share and i will feel terrible afterwards, but so incredibly happy. this place is really just amazing.
13860	71	4.0	1	2013-04-10	Excellent food. Although the menu seems limited everything on it is fantastic. I would definitely come with a large group to try a lot of the small plates. One large plate and 2 small plates is probably just over the edge of what's fine for 2 people. The highlight for me was the khao sai. The restaurant is really well set up, its definitely not a quiet night out place but service was prompt and attentive. I need to go back to get to those other small plates.
13861	71	4.0	1	2013-04-09	YUM! Get the Sizzling Sisig. Delicious.
5620	71	4.0	1	2013-04-08	"I'm really liking these casual eatery concepts launched by Top Chef alums. Sure, these great chefs all have pedigrees worthy of working in many fine dining establishments - but it's wonderful when Top Chef alums like Leah Cohen instead deliver something much more approachable, but with great execution and inventive flavors. Pig and Khao rides on the same ""Southeast Asian/fusion"" wave that's pretty much sweeping the city at the moment. And with good reason. I have long felt that Southeast Asian cuisine has been long overlooked by the majority of diners, especially real critics who don't tend to place it in the same realm as French or New American. Pig and Khao offers shareable plates with Filipino, Vietnamese and Thai influences - some of which are truly authentic while others offer a more modern twist. Whatever you order, prepare for a full throttle assault of unrelenting flavors. The bf and I came here for brunch recently, hoping to catch the kitchen while they were less busy. The dining room is surprisingly spacious, with an open kitchen and bar seating that faces the hot grills and chefs at work. Leah herself was actually in the kitchen that afternoon, as if she had just casually rolled out of her apartment and decided to come in to cook alongside the other chefs. We ended up sharing three plates: the Chinese sausage salad, Khao soi, and Sizzling sisig with a generous side order of garlic fried rice. The sisig (a Filipino dish of various pig parts) was fatty and comforting in all the right ways, with large bits of pig ears, snout, jowl and fat fried to a crisp on the sizzling cast iron platter. A raw egg came cracked on top, which cooked as we mixed it into the various pork chunks and drizzled with lime juice for some acidic necessity. I found the addition of lemongrass and chili in the sisig to be a little bit of a spin on the traditional sisig I've had in the past, but really enjoyed it because it actually helped to brighten up the absolutely indulgent dish. The garlic rice was tasty as well, still retaining a little bit of chew from the slightly sticky short grain rice. The Chinese sausage salad leaned more towards the Thai side of the spectrum, reminiscent of a Thai larb salad with tomato, cucumber, shallot, toasted rice powder, coriander and lime-fish sauce over bibb lettuce. I grew up eating the pungent and sweet Chinese sausage, but found the use of it in this spicy and tangy dish totally refreshing as it tickled every part of my palate. We ordered strategically, as the salad also served as a good palate cleanser for the sisig. The khao soi, another traditional Thai curry noodle dish, was impressive as well. The slightly spicy and thick red curry broth was tempered by the addition of coconut milk, while the pickled mustard greens, shallots and lemongrass on top added another dimension and some freshness. We also really liked the contrasting textures from the cooked egg noodles and crispy fried egg noodles on top, which kept eating an entire bowl interesting bite after bite. It was a hearty bowl indeed, especially swimming in that luscious and thick curry broth - so I'd highly recommend sharing it with everyone at the table. Sadly, we were too full after those dishes and couldn't afford the halo halo dessert, which I've heard a many great things about. I am definitely looking to make a return trip soon for dinner - certainly with more friends so that we can try more dishes."
13862	71	3.0	1	2013-04-05	I really wanted to ADORE Pig and Khao, but somehow I did not.  I really wanted to give it more than 3 stars but at the end of the day, after much contemplation there were too many let downs for me to lie to myself or the world of Yelp.   First of all, there really is something wrong with the management of the tables.  It's like they are a bit confused about who is organizing the seating. We ordered a $1 beer (YAY!) and set to reading the menu.   Of course the sizzling sisig, the pork jowl and watermelon salad, the red curry and finally the lamb ribs.  The sisig and the salad were good, and they actually went well with the coconut rice.  I loved the curry, and did not find it in the least bit too spicy.  It had just the right amount of heat, and the flavors were good. The lamb was a disaster.  It smelled gamey, the ribs were flabby and fatty, and the spices came off on my fingers with a greasy film.  I could barely manage a bite of them and they destroyed my palate and made my stomach churn.  Lama-the drama, the drama! Yes yes, it was dramatic. Also, this place is EXPENSIVE.  Really too much for what you get. Would I come back? Yes sure, with a bigger group and try the pig's foot.   But for now, there are details that need ironing out to become a place that's worthy of 4/5 stardom.
5737	71	4.0	1	2013-04-05	"The food club descended on the lower east side on a Thursday night for its inaugural meeting at pig and khao. From the team behind fatty crab and cue, this unassuming restaurant had opened to much fanfare several months prior, but has appeared to cbs live up to its much hyped potential. After arriving a few minutes after our 7pm reservation, our group was promptly seated. The restaurant had a pleasantly energetic vibe, without ever crossing the line into over-crowded. In keeping with the standard for the rest of the night, out waitress was prompt and polite in bringing us menus and water, and enlightening us on the specials of the night. Starting with the libations, our collective curiosity was immediately piqued by the alluring bottomless self serve draft beer option, priced at a reasonable fifteen dollars (miller high life when we were there, but not specified on the menu so presumably subject to change). However, on closer consideration, the group settled on a la carte ordering, given the very reasonably priced beer selection on offer. This included a three dollar genessee cream ale that did not exceed the expectations set by the waitress's description of two notches above PBR). An order of spiced chickpeas accompanied our drinks. While a tasty alternative to standard bar nuts, these were a worthwhile order only in light of their very reasonable price point. The food menu, clearly composed with an eye to sharing, was comprised mainly of a variety of small plates in a tapas style, in addition to a couple of snacky starters and more substantial large parts. Chef Leah Cohen, a former top chef contestant (perhaps most memorable for her on screen romance with fellow contestant Hosea) confided that she had spent the last several years in Asia learning the art of Filipino cooking, which she fused with influences from Thailand and Vietnam. The dishes that adorned the resulting menu were tantalizing to say the least; it was a feat of restraint to quell our initial instinct to order everything on the menu. Our eventual order included: -Chinese sausage salad -""sisig"" pig head -mussels -pork jowl -khao sui -sirloin steak -quail adobo (fittingly served with quail egg) The food was generally of a high quality, featuring varied and complex flavors that truly lived up to its fusion billing. The standout choice for the collective group favorite was the pig head which hit the mark on counts of both texture and taste. I also personally very much enjoyed the sausage salad, which was reminiscent of a thai som tum, albeit with the dried shrimp substituted for sausage. Less exciting to me were the mussels and the steak - heard to mess up, but not the most exciting versions of those proteins that I have sampled. In keeping with the themes of abundance and indulgence, the group opted to sample both desserts on offer. This included fried bananas with salted caramel ice cream, as well as a mélange of Taro ice cream, shaved rice and flan. I found the ice cream to be the highlight of both options; each held its own, but neither were exceptional. After lightening our wallets a reasonable amount (perhaps we over-indulged but I would rate this restaurant more $$$ than $$), we left happy and sated, and with no dearth of apres dinner destination choices surrounding the restaurant's convenient Lower East Side location. Not surprisingly, the food club's next two stops were at other food establishments in the area.."
13863	71	4.0	1	2013-04-04	We highly recommend the jowl served with watermelon, chicharron and spices. As Filipinos we were surprised by the fantastic combination of familiar flavors. The sisig was good for sisig (dont't love pig head to begin with), but I wish I ordered something else. The coconut rice was too sweet.
13864	71	3.0	1	2013-04-03	Food is good but not great, a bit heavy, fatty meat, and fried.... Pet peeve if you say what kind of rice with an Asian dish I expect it to be free, these are not Chinatown prices so why charge me three bucks for rice...in the end I liked it but won't return
13865	71	4.0	1	2013-04-02	Came here to pig out (literally!) with Lama after a long crazy day.  We started with some $1 happy hour beers and ordered the pork jowl, sizzling sisig, khao soi with some coconut rice on the side and the lamb ribs.   The 3 small plates were excellent, in particular I liked the sizzling sisig and how it was served on sizzling plate with a raw egg that was to be cooked by the heat from the plate and then mixed in with the tasty bits of pork.  The lamb ribs were a bit fatty for my liking, but came with a side of yogurt, pickled beets and a small wheat wrap to roll it all up in. There was no room left for dessert in the end.
13866	71	5.0	1	2013-04-01	"This has become our go-to place for amazing (Asian inspired) food. Great flavors, solid service and beer tastes soooo much better when you drink it ""Hong Kong"" style!!!"
5492	71	5.0	1	2013-04-01	"Lack of planning is awesome! Our failures in researching the restaurant we'd been intent on led us to a closed door. We decided halfheartedly on another, passed Pig & Khao while walking there, and stepped in on a whim (read: it was freezing and we were lazy and I like puns). Weekday, 7pm: only 2 or 3 tables occupied. We were seated immediately - no reservation! (By 8pm: packed and getting uncomfortably noisy.) The server informed us that two small plates and one large plate was a good amount for 2 people. He lied. It is too much. ""Small plates"" on the menu does NOT mean tapas. Other lessons: Dishes are ordered on the menu from ""light"" to ""heavy."" One bowl of rice is enough for two people. The menu being relatively concise is probably the best and worst part of P&K. Most people will be inclined toward the same few items. We opted for the Sizzling Sisig (pig head!), Khao Soi (red curry!) and Crispy Pata (pig leg!). The sizzling sisig was the winner of the evening. This is actually a good-sized portion if you're pairing it with rice. Don't worry, the fact that it's a pig head is unrecognizable (morbid remark, sorry), with the exception of the munchy crunchy cartilage bits (not sorry for this one). We loved the spicy and lemongrassy hints, plus the heartiness that the egg added. Lori L describes this dish as underseasoned, but to me there were many surprisingly salty notes - to the extent that I enjoyed it better with rice. It reminded me of Taiwanese ""lu rou,"" and has motivated me to hunt down sizzling sisig elsewhere. The khao soi came next (we suspected they were bringing out dishes in the sequence in which we ordered them..), and was a perfect level of spiciness. But the mass of egg noodles drowned in the curry was unexpected and perplexing, and contributed to how shockingly filling this dish was. It was good, but if you're going to come here, fill your tummy with something else. Last was the crispy pata. In a puddle of guilt mid-curry, I realized we couldn't possibly finish it and asked the waiter if the dish had been made yet. He said he'd ask the kitchen (which made me feel like an idiot, since we were sitting in front of the kitchen...). I was itching to cancel it and go for dessert instead, but he came back and said it was ready for plating, but that he could box it up for us. Ah, well. The only thing to say when you're having a great meal and are presented with more food even though you're sad and full already: ""Bring it on!"" I'm glad we tried the pata - it's like a saltier version of German pork knuckle. I had a couple arguments with my friend about this one. I won both: Yes, one of the two dipping sauces is made with pate. No, the pile of white tuber at the side of the plate is not pickled daikon (nor was it tuber). Not sure I enjoyed that green mango much, or that it even did much in cutting the fattiness of the pork, but the two dipping sauces were both brilliant accompaniment to the meat, essentially creating two different, equally delicious dishes. (We ended up each claiming a sauce.) I'd love to see how Pig & Khao's menu evolves in the future. If anything about our dinner was less than perfect, it was the fact that for all the deliciousness, I would've appreciated more diversity in the menu. Yes, the theme is pork and fat and indulgence (and that hasn't been novel for awhile now!), but weeks after the meal, I'm thinking back and I wish we had had more significant sour or cool components in any of the food. Or more mellow/starchy dishes. (And hell if I'm ordering a salad.) As it stands, eating here works less as a focused dinner and more as a laid-back fat-and-protein-gobbling adventure. With beer. They seem to anticipate this and offer $1 Coors Light 5-7pm, but that sort of glorious loafing around seems impossible at the moment, considering how hectic P&K is at the height of its hype."

The food was incredible and honestly worth the wait. We got one of almost everything to share - the Khao Soi and Coconut rice topped out as my absolute favorite! Go very hungry!!
13868	71	3.0	1	2013-03-30	Now I understand. It's listed as Asian fusion which explains the spiciness of all of the food on the menu. Don't get me wrong, it was good but just not what I was expecting for Filipino cuisine. P.S. Order the Sangria
13869	71	1.0	1	2013-03-30	"BEWARE- they try to scam large groups by adding 2 tips in the check and hoping people won't notice.   They included an 18%  tip in the ""subtotal"" without telling us the tip was included, and then printed out another 20% tip for us to sign, hoping we were too wined up to realize there were 2 tips on the check.   When someone in our group of 6 called them out  on it , the waitress had to get someone else to explain.. A guy came over said the double tipping was that it was a ""software problem"" they'd been trying to fix it for a ""while"" ...Gimme a break!"
9322	71	5.0	1	2013-03-27	"I'm a fan.  Went here for my girl's birthday because she's somewhat Filipino, and loves the pork.  A glance at the menu will tell you that everything except the chickpea appetizer and the deserts has pork in it, so I was excited to see if as a vegetarian if I was going to eat chickpeas all night, or if Pig and Khao was going to hook it up for me.  We made a reservation and had no problem getting seated as we arrived on time.  Restaurant is cute and what you would expect to find in LES; my table enjoyed the 90's throwback rap music playing all night.  For drinks I would recommend the red wine sangria ($10) because it was strong and not overly sweet, and the Sweet & Sour Cilantro Soda ($5) which my whole table LOVED and everyone wished P&K had an alcoholic version on the menu.  The food is served family style with dishes brought out as they are ready, so dinner is kind of a free for all. - The Spiced Chickpeas ($3) were good and crunchy, but I'm not sure I'd order this again.   - Chinese Sausage Salad ($9) was reported to be spicy, and everybody enjoyed wrapping the ground pork in the lettuce wraps.  One of our party doesn't usually eat pork, but was able to try this dish because she said it looked like ground chicken, and she was cool with that.   - Grilled Pork Jowel ($13), was a hit at our table. - Khao Soi ($16, red curry, coconut milk, chicken, egg  noodles, pickled mustard greens, shallots) I was able to substitute the chicken with tofu and was really happy with it.  The soft and crunchy noodles gave the dish a nice contrast of texture and the curry and coconut milk combo was yummy, creamy, and spicy.  I would order this again in a heartbeat.   - Coconut rice ($3) was extremely flavorful.   For desert we had both options: Turon ($8, banana fritter, salted caramel ice cream, chocolate sauce) and HALO-HALO ($8, shaved ice, leche flan, ube ice cream, macapuno, pinipig) and while both were good, I loved the Turon because fried bananas + salty ice cream = Bliss.  The Halo-Halo  had some great textures in it and I really liked the rice crispy pieces, but the shaved ice component made it a little too chilly to comfortably eat, which was true for just about everyone at my table. I'm gonna recommend P&K for vegetarians because I really enjoyed my meal.  Our waiter was so nice about customizing a dish for me and answered all my ""is it cooked in chicken broth?"" type questions, and even gave me 3 or 4 options from the menu which could be made vegetarian or pescatarian.  The menu is relatively small, so to have as many options as I did was truly impressive.  Service throughout the meal was wonderful, our waiter was great, our water cups were refilled constantly, and I really couldn't think of anything I did not like.  And this brings me to the bill, usually the sad part of the evening.  Coming in at a very reasonable $43 per person (including tip) and we were all stuffed, this has to be the cheapest celebratory dinner I've attended in ages.  I've paid more for brunch and left hungry. 4 stars - food 5 stars - price 5 stars - vegetarian rating for a pork restaurant"
13870	71	2.0	1	2013-03-26	"There is one kind of restaurant in NYC where you like the ""idea"" of going there more than the actual dining experience there, and I think it summarizes what I want to say about Pig and Khao. My husband was excited about trying Pig and Khao after reading the NYT review. I made a reservation for 6:30 pm on a Friday evening, but we still had to wait for 25 minutes even though we arrived on time. So we just sat there, simmering in the kitchen smoke permeating the whole tiny restaurant. The restaurant was dim, loud, and very vibrant, and it did feel like a ""happening place."" The tables and seats were very tight, but we didn't mind at all, because we liked the idea of going to Pig and Khao. And our excitement started to die down after we tried the food. Most of the items on the menu were either deep fried or grilled, and very greasy. We felt a bit tired of its lack of cooking variety in its dishes. The following is what we ordered: 1. GRILLED PORK JOWL: it came with watermelon, fried pork rinds, and lime-chili fish sauce. This turned out to be my favorite dish of the evening. I wonder if it was because it was the first dish served. 2. QUAIL ADOBO: this dish was more like fried quail drizzled with soy sauce. 3. SIZZLING SISIG: a very greasy dish with chopped pork head -- a mixture of pig's ears, fat, and things that I couldn't identify. The only flavor was from the ""charred"" part of the pork head. 4. Banana Fritters: 4 cut pieces of fried spring rolls stuffed with banana, with salty caramel ice cream on the side. 5. Vietnamese coffee: A bit too watery and no aroma, not enough condensed milk. 6. $1 beer between 5-7 pm. 7. Jasmine rice Disappointment aside, I just felt uncomfortable after all these greasy foods. What's worse, we left the restaurant carrying the kitchen smoke with us -- we smelled from ""hair"" to toe. My coat, sweater, underwear, and even my bag, all smelled badly after I got home. Please work on the ventilation!"
13871	71	5.0	1	2013-03-26	"I am admittedly a bit closed minded when it comes to trying ""different"" types of food.  When I first looked at this menu in preparation for my dinner there with friends, I thought to myself... YUCK!  Pig head?!  Quail eggs?!?!?!  Hell to the NO.  I had already pre-planned what I wanted to order - there was fish.  Fish is basic enough for me.  So we get to the restaurant and it is very small, but cute.  Nice lively vibe.  Music a little loud (but I'm starting to think the music is loud everywhere so it's probably not the music and just my old age setting in).  In any event, we ordered drinks while waiting in the little corner for our table.  The drinks... wow!!  So unusual but so good - had punch - and it had a good little kick!  And then it was time to eat.  Someone in our group was already familiar with the food there so she ordered for us.  Absolutely recommended the sisig and the lamb.  I said, don't tell me what sisig is and I couldn't remember what I read on the menu.  And the next thing I said was I don't eat lamb.  But....this closed minded girl ate lamb and it was AMAZING!  And sisig - lo and  behold, was pig head!!!!! Of course, I gulped after the fact, but honestly, it was sooooo good that I would absolutely go there and eat it again!   We did also order the fish, upon my request - and that was good too!  And then their desserts... the halo halo.  Wow!!!   This place ROCKS!!!!  Food was tasty, service was great!  Loved it!!!"
13872	71	3.0	1	2013-03-25	Ate here for brunch with my family. Cool little restaurant. Make a reservation! Seating is pretty small. Brunch portions were tiny but enough to share for 7 people. I had the champorado. That seems to be the only vegetarian safe item on the menu. It was really delicious. Chocolate, coconut milk, sweet, but not too sweet. I also had some garlic fried rice but I think it was cooked in meat, yuck. For omnivores and foodies, this is a culinary delight. Bottomless mimosas keep the party going. They also serve coconut water from the young coconut itself! Too bad that they waste the meat! I definitely like the decor of the restaurant, modern, clean, but not cramped. Staff was friendly and helpful. We were pretty loud but no one gave us a hard time, heehee! Oh and jamz!!!!! Their music was off the chain yo.
13873	71	3.0	1	2013-03-25	i took my husband and friend to Pig and Khao last weekend because I enjoyed the first time I went there.  My husband is not as adventurous with food so we ordered the grilled sirloin.  The dish came and it was really rare, so we asked the waiter if they can put it on the grill for a few minutes.  the waiter instantly told us that that is they way the check cooks it and the chef will refuse to cook it for us without even asking the chef.  Considering that was the only dish on the menu that my husband can eat, I really believe they should have cooked the grilled sirloin according to the customer's preference since we are paying for it.  But the restaurant didn't budge and my husband ended up eating just rice.... what a let down also the music is too loud and there isn't enough ventilation!   Being that this is a new restaurant and they got 2 stars in NY times, if they keep up with this arrogance, i really honestly believe they will lose a lot of customers in the long run....
13874	71	2.0	1	2013-03-23	I hate to have to write this review but after my experience last night I'm left with no choice. Note: this is not a review of the food. As big Fatty Crew fans, my boyfriend and I were super excited to try Pig and Khao. We arrived at 6:05 (20 minutes late for our 5:45 reservation) and apologized for our tardiness. The male host informed us that he had marked us as a no-show and given our table to a walk-in. Understandable. Our bad for being late. As he's trying to figure out what to do with us a blonde woman appears and rudely tells us the restaurant's policy is to hold reservations for 15 minutes and since they had already given our table away there was no way we'd be able to eat there that night. But there's 3 empty tables I point out. All reserved. Ok, what about the bar? No, it's full. We can wait. We're all booked for tonight. Suggestion to future diners: DON'T BE LATE! Never in 8 years of living in NYC have I been flat out turned away by a restaurant. I'd love to give Pig and Khao another chance but this experience left a really bad taste in my mouth. So across the street we went to Yunnan Kitchen. And what lovely service we received!
13875	71	2.0	1	2013-03-22	"Pig and Khao, how I wish I could love you.  Why such a bad rating for such an amazing restaurant?  Service, Service, SERVICE.  It all started off so great, I arrive before the girlfriend and immediately grab the happy hour special, $1 PBR.  Sweet.  As we're seated because we're early the host puts us in a better table, saying we may have to move if we're not finished by 8.  No big deal, we had plenty of time to eat provided the service was up to snuff.  And of course there is no reason to believe it's not going to be fast since the restaurant was fairly empty. To start off, the waiter is kind enough to honor another PBR happy hour special a minute after 7:00 nice!  We place our order for the Sisig, khao soi, and whole fried fish.  And then the wait begins.  A table to our right is seated after us after about 5 minutes.  They place their order and their order quickly comes out.  Strange......we wait and wait some more.  They finish their sisig and we still have nothing.  Table to our left was seated meanwhile places an order and bada bing, their dish comes out and we have nothing.  Now simmering in anger, I flag down the waiter as he seats another table near us, asking where's our order.  He's shocked that nothing has come out.  He scampers off to the computer and literally a few seconds later, I hear the chef shout out ""Fire a fish"", shaking my head I knew that was ours.  We then receive a pig skin ""on the house"".  Within 5 minutes our sisig arrives and finally the food starts to come to our table.  Gee that only took 35 minutes AFTER we ordered. Yeah, they forgot about us with nary an apology.  There wasn't an apology until the end of the meal when I questioned why we didn't receive our order to which he attributed it to a ""ticket error"".  Whether that was truthful or not, it was at least plausible but I was still not very happy.   The food was amazingly good.  I enjoyed the sisig, whole fried fish, and the khao soi immensely as everything was well seasoned, flavorful, and literally not a single complaint about any of the dishes, well except the ""on the house"" pig skins as we didn't touch those damn things other than the first piece.  Needless to say, I won't be back at Pig and Khao for their lousy service even though I wish I could because the food was great."
13876	71	3.0	1	2013-03-21	Filipino fusion food. Sounds interesting, right? Not something you hear everyday. Filipino food in general isn't a popular cuisine, even in the melting pot that is New York City. It's hard to make a big pig's foot or bowl of chicken adobo look classy, though Chef Leah Cohen may have done it with her modern approach to Southeast Asian fusion. Myself and four others arrived on St. Patty's Day without a reservation. The door swung open, our ears were met with the sound of 90's rap. It seemed only appropriate given its location in the LES. The dining room/semi-open kitchen were small and busy, packing a forty-five minute wait. Not necessarily a bad thing, unless it was a rainy winter night and the only available seating was on the patio, as was the case for us. A busboy was kind enough to wipe the table and chairs off for us. A perfect time for us to sample the drink selection. I'm no beer drinker and I've never had a Michelada, but after two, I was hooked. I never knew I possessed a spot within beer's reach, but the tangy, savory, barely beer-tasting cocktail definitely hit it. Time passed quickly and when our table was called, hunger had more than set in. I'll admit, we may have gotten a little carried away. Our order went as follows: 3 Chicharron 3 Quail Adobo 2 Crispy Pata 3 Sizzling Sisig 1 Grilled Curry Lamb Ribs 2 Khao Soi 1 Special Dessert upon request The Chicharron were crunchy yet light and fluffy all at once--  as if that's even possible. I wish the coconut vinegar had been sharper; fried food needs acid to cut through the richness. The Quail Adobo was interesting. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. A small dish of breaded and fried dark meat quarters smothered in a sort of adobo-ish sauce. There was a sweet, almost creamy addition to the traditional soy and vinegar based sauce, though the menu makes no mention of one. I was intrigued and unable to pinpoint the exact flavor, though butter sounds about right as it would allow the sauce to coat the meat as it did. The size of the meat and frailty of the bones wore their welcome quickly. I found myself wishing it were a huge pork rib or chicken drumstick. The breading was more like a light dusting of rice flour; and added a nice little crunch; a texture traditional adobo lacks. The Crispy Pata was a whole lot of succulent, fried, fatty, salty, delicious knuckle of pig, already deboned, sliced,and fanned. Textures were at play here: boiled fork-tender, well seasoned meat and slightly thick crackly-fried skin. The Sizzling Sisig-- a blistering cast iron platter of cubed pork head with a raw egg, cilantro and sliced chili over top-- stole the show. Before eating, we swirled everything with a chopstick; allowing the egg to cook lightly from the residual heat of the platter. The egg added a silky contrast while vinegar-- the only obvious remaining addition-- completed the dish. The Grilled Lamb Ribs were good, at best, and the portion size was nice. The various elements of the dish: the lamb, pickled beets and whole wheat roti chapati were all well executed; but as a whole, the dish felt uninventive and, well...boring in comparison to the other dishes. Khao Soi was a soup full of both boiled and deep fried egg noodles, lumps of chicken breast and mustard greens. The deeply vibrant orange soup had intense curry flavor and a good amount of heat, all perfectly infused into a creamy coconut milk broth. Also a good sized portion; suited for sharing as a first course. In all fairness, this dish arrived to the table close to last; at which point I was beyond full. Had I paced myself better, I may have been moved by this dish. The Thai Tea Ice Cream Sandwich was not featured on the menu and should be. Thai iced tea ice cream is an amazing concept; one I have never thought of nor seen before. (Probably indicative of how often I try new ice cream flavors.) The Chinese donuts were dry, a little tough (maybe due to temperature) and made the dish difficult to eat. Perhaps just a plating issue. Simple Filipino fare was certainly transformed into a slightly more refined version of itself and, in some ways, I appreciate Chef Cohen's twist on old recipes. However, I learned I must be somewhat of a purist at heart; and apparently more so when it comes to the food of my people. I only miss the truest versions of these dishes now more than ever. I'd recommend Pig & Khao and especially to those looking for a flavorfully fun (and hip) twist on classic Southeast Asian cuisine. Just don't expect what grandma used to make.
13877	71	4.0	1	2013-03-20	This place was sick!  Went last week with the wife and friends, and P&K did not disappoint.  From the $1 beer to curry, to the pork, everything was done nicely. But here's the secret, the lamb ribs are actually the best dish!!!  Especially for leftovers!! So run to this place now, before all the New York Times readers hog up all the reservations!
13878	71	4.0	1	2013-03-20	Very impressed.  Delicious food, friendly service, and a fun atmosphere.  Definitely not for a vegetarian.  The smell of roasted pork hit us the moment we walked in the door which is always a good sign.  The three of us had problems narrowing down our dish choice and our waiter was very helpful with recs, and how much food we should actually order.   We got the red rice which was probably my favorite dish of the night.  Great flavor, pretty complex, and just a little bit of spice.  The Khao Soi noodles were also great.  The sauce was really flavorful, and once the noodles were gone I sopped up the rest with my coconut rice.  The other two dishes we got (quail, and the lamb) were good, but I wouldn't say outstanding.  The flavors were just a little bland and uninteresting, especially on the quail.   For dessert we got the banana fritters with salted caramel ice cream.  I was full, but managed to eat two pieces of this dipped in the delicious ice cream.  I'd highly recommend it.   Overall, a great meal, and I will be back.
13879	71	4.0	1	2013-03-20	Anytime is a great time for Filipino Food. Throw in a Mimosa and you have a great Filipino Brunch! I wanted to step out of the ordinary brunch menu of scrambled eggs and French Toast. Pig & Khao offers a lot of Filipino favorites such as Longonissa, Sizzling Sisig and even Champorado with BACON. They also have Sizzling Corned beef Hash, Grilled Pork Jowl and Green Mango Salad to name a few. You can scope out the whole Brunch Menu here: pigandkhao.com/wp-conten… I stayed loyal to my heritage and ordered some Sizzling Sisig. Anywhere I go, I always try the sisig. I've been to a place in Brooklyn that served it in a bowl. Basically a bowl full of grease. I wasn't really pleased. This place does it very well and it comes to you piping hot. You have the choice on breaking the egg and mixing it all in. I've seen others let the yolk cook a bit through. I just mix it all in. Squeeze some lime and your good to go. I also got the Grilled Pork Jowl which consists of watermelon, chicharron, toasted rice, chili-lime fish sauce and some herbs. This was pretty tasty and all the elements went well together. I let the chicharron sit in the fish sauce for a bit to soak up all the flavor. The dish was a perfect blend of sweet, salty and had lots of layers of flavor. Brunch isn't complete without a Mimoas. Pig and Khao offers FOUR different kinds to choose from. You can get OJ, Lychee, Watermelon and Mango. Can't make up your mind? Try all 4. Mimosas run $8 a glass, but you can get BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS for $15. That's a sweet deal! All in all the meal was very good. My only drawback was that the entrees didn't include rice. It will cost $3-4 for a small bowl of rice. It's not a big deal, but when you go to other Filipino restaurants it's included. The staff was very attentive and on point. My glass of Mimosa was never empty. Average brunch for two people at this place would cost you $60, it's a bit expensive, but the Bottomless Mimosas makes it all worth it.
5630	71	4.0	1	2013-03-18	Good food, fast service. There's a little bar area and waiting area by the entrance. Open kitchen in the middle with a few counter seats. We started off with the green mango salad. It's pretty vinegary, which is how I like it. I wish they would have incorporated the chicken into it somehow, rather than just laying it on top. Next up was the crispy red curry rice salad. This comes with lettuce to serve as a wrap. The bf really liked this. We ended with the sizzling sisig (pig head). The waitress highly recommended this and said it often sells out. It comes in a sizzling cast iron with an egg in the middle. I guess it's their version of eggs and bacon? Pretty good, though you should be aware it's a bit fatty. We also got a side of yummy coconut rice, which was soft and slightly coconut flavored. The bf is already planning to come back and take advantage of the self serve bottomless draft for $15.
13880	71	2.0	1	2013-03-16	Too expensive for small portions.  Was seated promptly.  In Manhattan but not very conveniently located, is somewhat far from subway lines and stops.  Menu is a combination of Filipino, Thai, Indian.  I went for Filipino food but found relatively few filipino dishes. Recommend Grill 21 instead, or Cafe 81 if and when it opens again after the hurricane.
13881	71	2.0	1	2013-03-15	"Service (skip this if you don't want to read a rant): Came here on a Friday night with a friend and while we didn't expect to be seated right away, we didn't expect the est. wait time to be 1.5hrs either. It wasn't a big deal though, so we put our name down and wandered around the neighborhood scoping out other options. About a hour passed and we decided to call to check on availability. The worker who picked up said the most ridiculous thing ever-- ""Well, you put your name down at around 7:30, and it's only been a hr, so maybe in another half hour."" EXCUSE ME?! Since when did est. time trump availability?! At this point, we were not happy with the service and decided to head to Chinatown for some actual Asian food. Suddenly, we get a text saying there is a table available for us now. Fine. Can't argue with a starving stomach. We walked in to see not one, but FIVE empty tables. RIDICULOUS. We had to wait a hr when they had FIVE freaking empty tables. And then what you ask? They seat us in the worst table possible. Right by the bathroom. All the way in the back. In a corner. We felt like victims ....of clientele profiling? What? Did we not look hip enough? Did they not expect to serve Asian food to Asians? *SHRUG* Fast forward to the food: Chicharron - Don't bother. You get better from the packaged ones at the corner bodega. Green Mango Salad - I am a fan of Thai Mango Salad. And I am a fan of fish sauce. But this salad was swimming in fish sauce and lime juice that were not evenly mixed together. It just didn't blend. And I'm not saying the ingredients they used don't go well together--they do, but just not in this case. I don't know what went wrong, but it did. Overly salted and the chicken tastes like a poor rendition of the grilled chicken you get at Viet restaurants. Grilled Pork Jowl - Wait, what? I thought I was eating the Mango Salad again. The flavors are too similar. If you HAD to order one, I guess go with this one. Also overly salted. Quail Adobo -  The flavor is not bad, but the batter just didn't work well with the quail. For a tiny poultry, the batter definitely overpowered the quail. Mussels - The best tasting item of the night came from this dish. The montao. Pretty sad that their best tasting item is a piece of bun. All in all, none of the dishes were terrible, but nothing was good either. Except for the bun. Would I come back? No. Would I recommend? No."
13882	71	2.0	1	2013-03-14	"Came here a while back... First off, the positives...  the menu is simple and wait staff were willing to explain any thing you needed to know.  Some stuff are spicy so be sure to ask if that is not your thing.  The drinks were great.  There were a good amt of selections so if you are adventurous, this is your spot. If you enjoy cheap beer, be sure to check that out too!  The weekdays were so crowded and I am sure it is because of the inexpensive beer prices.   Now...the food - that requires literally maybe 1000 words to discuss...I went with friends who knows the ""origins"" of all these dishes. Let's just say in shorter words that it was not up to par based on their standards/background.  I do not like to criticize 'fusion' or food genres that may have gone through transformations of some sort.  I believe that all restauranteurs/chefs have the right and freedom to bring to the public any sort of food however they like.  So that's that for the food part.   People were waiting over an hour for seats.  This place is SUPER BUSY... esp on Tuesday nights.  Guess that is what a top chef owner will bring!  Meanwhile, noticing the other reviews, this place has had excellent feedback. Now, the more important details that I really have to offer is that aside from the tight squeeze (which is ok for the LES atmosphere), I had a situation with them.  I called in advance because of a disability requirement that needed extra space.  On the phone, I wanted to explain that the space was required but the person on the phone said to just show up and that it will be fine.  I trusted that they would accommodate my request. Needless to say, when I showed up, not only was my request ignored entirely but the staff made it sound as if my request was not even a big deal.  That was totally not cool.  As restaurant owners/investors/managers/marketers, we all should try our best to practice  satisfactory customer service all on levels because it can go a VERYYYY long way.  Sure the hipsters and trendy LES goers may be your most frequent customers (that I also understand) but I also think from a humane point of view, I just wish that attention is also paid to those who may not fit into the ""majority"" crowd.  I know this sounds like a complaint but I also feel it is legitimate to bring this up.. I do not think it is a lot to ask for."
13883	71	4.0	1	2013-03-12	We decided to go here one Saturday night on a whim. That and the fact I had a Google offer for $15 for $30 helped sweeten the deal.  We waited for about an hour without reservations, which was kinda what I was expecting for a Saturday in LES.   The host was pretty cool, he made sure we had drinks and even offered us chicharron to help satisfy our already growling stomachs.  After finally getting a table, we quickley went about our normal routine, which is ordering more than enough food.  In addition to the chicharrons we had been munching on, we ordered the lumpia shanghai, crispy pata, sisig, and a few orders of coconut rice.  All dishes were amazing, in my opinion, although I was expecting the crispy pata to be a little bigger.  The pata was served with a vinagar/soy sauce and a Mang Thomas like sauce, but with a taste of liver in it.  It sounds weird, but it was amazing. The sisig was another star of the show, it was served on sizzling skillet along with a raw egg that gets cooked as you mix the dish at the table.  I've never had it served this way, but it was a welcome surprise when taken with lime juice drizzled on top.  The coconut rice tied everything together nicely when mixed with the dishes.   This was definitely family style food elevated to another level.  I highly recommend coming here and I will definitely be coming back.  Just be prepared to wait.
9365	71	4.0	1	2013-03-11	Been here twice. Great place. Leah is super cool and definitely a hard worker. Glad I can support her. Sizzling Sisig is delicious, super rich. Khao Soi is solid. Lamb ribs are amazing. Fried fish is really good too. Def Recommend
13884	71	5.0	1	2013-03-10	Refreshingly casual, awesome food, cool atmosphere (90s hip hop as noted by other Yelpers) and great service made my Pig and Khao experience worthy of 5 stars. As a huge fan of Fatty Crab and Fatty Cue AND of top chef P&K has been on my list for a while and was psyched when we arrived for our reservation and were immediately seated.  T, A and I scanned the menu but knew we'd be eating everything family-style and focused on the sides, small plates and snacks.   Our waitress was chill and very accessible, our drinks arrived almost immediately.  A got an ice cold Porkslap and my Phuket Punch was a perfect compliment to our spicy food -- crisp, balanced between sweet and tart thanks to the grapefruit and cinnamon combo. We ordered and shared (ranked from awesomest to slightly less awesome) 1)  Sizzling Sisig - this was the highlight of our meal.  It does come out sizzling, a sunny-side up egg sightly undercooked cooking atop a pile of sizzling, glistening pork head.  You gently break the yoke and mix the egg and pork together, essentially gently scrambling the egg which binds together pork and egg in amazing delicious harmony.  Amazing with coconut rice. 2)  Grilled Pork Jowl - reminiscent of the pork belly & pickled watermelon at Fatty Crab, this version has pork rinds (yum), little watermelon cubes that are nicely pickled and grilled pork that is melt-in-your-mouth delicious. 3)  Quail Adobo - tiny quarters of quail perfectly fried to crispy perfection.  The meat was tender, came right off the bone and was finger-licking good. 4) Khao Soi - red curry noodles with crispy noodles on top with chicken and greens.  We paired ours with coconut rice (rice was delish) - I liked this dish but it was VERY spicy (I am a little bit of a wuss) so I didn't enjoy it as much as the other dishes. 5) Market vegetables (tasty, sauteed greens in a broth spiked with red thai peppers that made us feel better about the amount of pork fat consumed) In short, come here!!  Eat lots of pork, marvel at the crazy flavors and enjoy the 90s hip hop goodness.  Hats off to Leah Cohen - definitely a great meal
7137	71	4.0	1	2013-03-08	I ordered the Khai Soi dish here with a side of Longganisa Sausage. The noodles were really tasty and so was the curry. I liked the sausage (it was my first time) but my friends told me that it normally tastes better so I guess the sausage here was just average. My friends and I ordered the bottomless mimosas (they have lychee, mango, watermelon and I think one other flavor) which we're really good. Would definitely return here again.
13885	71	4.0	1	2013-03-07	Delicious southeast asian inspired dishes. Lots of crispy fat, meat, egg dishes with accompaniments that really bring out the flavor. Expect lots of lime, mint, cilantro, fish sauce and little vegetables. $1 high life from 5-7. I love the decor, brass and tin ceiling to make you feel like you're in an old New York institution, with clean lines and drafting type lamps to make it feel modern. The head chef was constantly supervising to make sure everything went out perfect from the small open kitchen. I sat at the bar to watch them cook, not disappointed. Sisig, crispy pata and mango chicken salad were the best.
13886	71	5.0	1	2013-03-05	"Kap-um-kap, Pig and Khao!  This place is so wildly authentic Thai that I expected a lady-boy to jump out the back and scream ""MASA-JEE!!""   Instead I was greeted by a bunch of hipsters in panama hats, toting liters of beer.  I'll take the hipsters with the 40's over the lady boys with lotion any day of the week, although the owners could step it up with Chang or Singha over Tiger (my only real complaint). Nevertheless, with so much Manhattan dining awash in stale, overpriced concepts, Pig and Khao is affordable, refreshing and Southeast Asian spicy (*note that the Southeast Asian spicy is equivalent to wildly hot by American standards but by this Yelper's account, friggin' awesome).   Fresh chillies, limes, cilantro and mint?  Yes, please.  Whole fried fish you can pick apart and dress the broth over coconut rice?  Outstanding.  Grilled chicken with green papaya, cashews, lime, mint and all the fixins'?  You betcha.  This place makes me want to renounce my American citizenship, hop on the back of a tuk-tuk and celebrate Thai independence day at a full moon party with illegal firecrackers, glow-in-the-dark body paint and bad house music.   I'm no monk but I would definitely burn some incense at the alter to show my gratitude to the owners of this fine establishment.  Nicely done, Pig and Khao, you've restored my faith in cool, delicious NYC restaurants without being too pretentious or too hipster-y either."
13887	71	5.0	1	2013-03-05	I thank the restaurant Gods for Fatty Crab's new outpost in LES. after the UWS joint was closed, I just haven't been getting my Fatty Crab fill and I will do almost anything to avoid Meat Packing. Food is delicious - in particular I was blown away by the mussels with fried Chinese style buns and sweet Chinese style sausage.   As soon as they get their liquor license, they are going to blow up. One complaint: they do not seem to have their kitchen vented properly yet - which creates a slight choke-effect in the dining area.  I expect this will be righted shortly.
13888	71	3.0	1	2013-03-05	Sizzling Sisig and Khao Soi - both very good. The service was also good. Attentive and professional. However, like most restaurants around the area the tables are way too close to each other. Hearing everyone else's conversation except ours was too distracting.
13889	71	5.0	1	2013-02-27	"100th review!   I don't believe in love at first sight, but I really do kind of, sort of love this place from the start.  Growing up in Seattle, I've had more than my fair share of incredible Asian food.   Jordan S's review of this place caught my attention.  Made a reservation via OpenTable and they only had an early dinner slot (6ish).  I'm glad I made that reservation, the place was packed!  .... And it seems that everyone also had a reservation.   When I heard about Pig & Khao, I was picturing a haute bourgeouise Asian Fusion place with ridiculous prices.  I was surprised to see how reasonable prices are.  $1 beer 5-7pm and $15 all-you-can-drink self-serve draft?!  Are we still in Manhattan?!  I wanted to order just about everything on the menu because almost everything had some sort of pork in it (and I can never say no to pork).  Exercising some self-control to save room for the halo-halo, my fiance and I decided to order the pork jowl salad, pork rinds, sizzling sisig (pork head), and coconut rice.  I went back and forth on wanting to also order the crispy pata (comparing pictures on foursquare and Yelp for a few minutes), but glad that I didn't.  The portion is pretty filling.   The pork jowl ""salad"" was very refreshing.  Pretty sure there was ZERO veggies in there other than the cilantro.  This is definitely how all salad should look like: with pork rinds on top.  It was tasty and they put just enough fish sauce to add an interesting taste to the mix without the overpowering fishy smell.  The pork rinds were perfectly seasoned and peppery.  Don't be afraid to order the sizzling sisig.  Yes, it's pork head, but it's diced into little cubes that you can hardly tell what it is anymore.  This dish is amazing... the fatty part just melts in your mouth and the leaner meat (if there is such thing in pork) is cooked to perfection.   As for the coconut rice, I prefer the Indonesian/Malay version that is less sweet, but the coconut rice here is pretty bomb too. Finally... drum roll please: the halo-halo!  I have a weird affinity for halo-halo.  If we ever meet in person, I'll tell you the story.  It's shaved ice with condensed milk, coconut shavings and an unnaturally purple ice cream on top (that's ube flavored). Perfect way to end your meal.  Service is great, friendly and unpretentious.  Space is clean (and the bathroom too!).  Food came out quickly.  Needless to say, I'll be back."
13890	71	5.0	1	2013-02-24	Fantastic food and service. I can't wait to go back. We ordered the ribs special to share. Had we known how good they would be we would have ordered a plate for each of us. The crispy garlic red curry salad was a great combination of flavors and textures. It's something I would probably order ever time I go. I loved how ever person I encountered working there made me feel like they were glad I was there. It was a nice feeling and experience! I just wish I hadn't been sitting near the back door. That is where the beer tap is so the door was constantly opening and shutting and it was quite cold the night I went. But it nicer weather the outdoor patio looks like it will be great.
13891	71	3.0	1	2013-02-21	The service is super nice, but the food is just okay. I would love to rate it better as I like the idea and the design, but the taste is simply not very impressive and the portions are small.
13892	71	5.0	1	2013-02-17	"Since the arrival of Fatty Crab in 2005,  the ""Fatty Crew"" has been opening comfortable, semi-hip, low-key restaurants exoticized by way of Southeast Asia across New York City. Given her mother's Filipino roots, and her recent travels throughout the region, it was no surprise that former Top Chef contestant Leah Cohen was tapped to head their latest venture: Pig and Khao. Pig and Khao is situated on a stretch of Clinton street that, while it has invariably begun the process of gentrification (which Pig and Khao doubtlessly contributes to), is not entirely overrun by assholes. Aside from knowledgeable residents of the area slinking in and out of Barramundi, and the 11pm rushes to Prosperity Dumpling, there is little here to suggest that you are in the nouveau Lower East Side; of insipid bars on every corner. Instead, Pig and Khao is the boisterous neighbor in a sleepy hamlet. Truly, it is best not to underestimate the obstreperous atmosphere within: if you enjoy having dinner with a significant other or date on the weekend, but also enjoy hearing them talk, you'd be best served coming at the restaurant's closing or opening. Primetime seems reserved for the hooters and hollerers. The noise is mitigated a bit if you manage to be seated at the kitchen counter, as M and I were. As an obvious added benefit, you get to see the dishes you're considering ordering as they're prepared for other parties. It then becomes a rather difficult proposition to be led by your stomach and not your eyes - the plates are surprisingly large, but the various sights will entice you to order more than any reasonable person ought to. After you've seen sumptuous flecks of pork being braised with various chilies and herbs, chaotically piled onto a cast iron pan, finished off with an egg cracked right down the center, sizzling through the dining room as it's carried away, try to resist ordering one of your own. It's nearly impossible. Equally evident from this seating arrangement is the control with which Ms. Cohen runs her kitchen. In spite of the relatively small breadth of the restaurant, it holds a sizable number of people at capacity, and the kitchen is quite small. But Ms. Cohen and her staff pushed out dish after dish with aplomb. And what a series of delightful dishes they were. M and I began with the Quail Adobo; sticky, vinegary, garlicky, peppery segments of bird that may have singlehandedly answered the question as to why Dick Cheney was intent on hunting them. I had no shame in pulling pieces of flesh from each wing and dipping them into the sauce that had pooled on our small porcelain plate. Such is the power of a sauce thoughtfully comprised of compatible, familiar elements. What followed was what I thought was sure to be our moment of truth; the Sizzling Sissig. The couple adjacent us smiled knowingly at the telltale crackle, having just polished off their own. As we mixed the freshly broken egg, the lime juice, and the caramelized bits of ephemera (ginger, kaffir leaves, bird chilies) the aroma became more than the sum of its parts, and we could mix no further without trying what was before us. The heaviness of the pork and egg was cut by the lime juice, but the smokiness afforded by the charred accoutrements enhanced the natural fattiness and surprising heartiness of the pork. The heat from the chilies lingered briefly, but only enough to assert its presence. Each bite was addicting, and the gambit of finishing the plate before the scattered bits grew cold took on a much more serious air than was necessary. After the pan was removed, we were presented with our penultimate dish: the Khao Soi. A bit redder in color than I had typically seen in Chiang Mai (where the dish originated), I was excited for what I presumed to be the additional heat, while M was terrified. Seeing her trepidation, the sous chef playfully handed her a few more lime segments. But in truth, what aided most in combating the spiciness was our side of coconut rice. Fluffy, sweet, and utterly saturated with coconut flavor, in part thanks to the actual slivers of coconut, it was the perfect accompaniment. The curry had an admirable depth, with the dark meat of the chicken thigh adding additional savoriness and the bitter, tangy punch of pickled mustard greens standing in for the traditional, brighter cilantro. The topping of fried egg noodles was a nod to the typical means of textural contrast. Between the size of the bowl of curry itself and the amount of rice paired with it, we were lucky to finish it, especially given the substantial amount of food we had eaten just prior. But when I saw Halo Halo on the menu, I knew from the onset that we would be trying it, gastrointestinal constraints be damned. The flan bits were an interesting twist, and a thoroughly welcome one, as the dessert was better than I remembered. Ms. Cohen, I fist bumped you ostensibly because of your choice of 2chainz as background music, but really, it was because of your food."
13893	71	4.0	1	2013-02-16	Walked in and bbq hit me in the face. It's a tight spot especially on a night like friday. Dinner date with my boyfriend and everything was pretty perfect. Service: 5 Price: 5 Food: * Sizzling Sisig: 4.5 ( I know it's the 'fatty' crew but I prefer less fat) * Coconut rice: 5 * Khao Soi: 4 Staff are awesome! Went with a google offer but would definitely visit again without it.
13894	71	5.0	1	2013-02-16	Pig and Khao was top on my list of places to try since reading Adam Platt's review of this restaurant, among others, in a recent NY Mag. This was only my second time trying Filippino food, but I must say it's quickly moving up my list of things I love to eat. We ordered the Sizling Sisig with coconut rice, Khao Soi, and the market vegetables all on the suggestion of our awesome waitress.  Everything is meant to be shared and they brought everything out in phases, which was nice. I wish the Sisig was a bit more crunch and less fatty (I had had it once before and it was more crunch than anything), but it was awesome anyway. The Khao Soi  is REALLY spicy, so be warned if you can't handle spice. My friend and I both like spicy and we had a bit of a tough time once we were at the bottom of the bowl. Our waitress said that some nights are spicier than others depending on what chilis they have, so perhaps we had a hot night. It was delicious, but order with caution. The market veggies were some bok choy-type thing in a garlic sauce. Veggies are rarely spectacular, but it was a nice addition to our meaty mains. Plus, I love a good stir-fried veggie. The space is really cool and the staff was fantastic. They have dollar beers from 5-7 which is a major plus, too.  I can't wait to go back and order a whole new set of delicious things!
8882	71	4.0	1	2013-02-15	I had high expectations because this place was a product of the fatty crew. And I wasn't disappointed. We started with spicy chickpeas, fried oysters (gluten-free batter by the way), moved on to their sisig, and fished with the sirloin. I enjoyed everything I ate but I do think it was bit pricey. It's supposed to be southeast Asian fusion but I'm sure that if I went to southeast Asia I could survive for a month with what I spent on dinner. That said, this is New York so it's to be expected. I'm not sure which dish was my favorite... maybe the sisig.
13895	71	5.0	1	2013-02-14	I'm so impressed! Leah knows her shit. Pig & Khao is probably one of the few legit joints w/ cool factor. Few hipsters can hang w/the intense smell of fish sauce, but if you know what's up, you know you can't do southeast asian cuisine w/out generous splashes of this stuff. Like other reviewers, we opted to skip the large dishes and dine on a selection of small plates, so as to maximize flavor variety. Every single dish was amazing. I couldn't pick a fave if I had to. First to come out: Leah's version of Larp. The red curry crispy rice is bomb. The entire dish is major bomb. Next: Quail Adobo. Again, major bomb. I don't think I've ever experienced such a flavor combination. Superb. Then came the Grilled Pork Jowl and Green Mango Salad. Freaking Amazing. Both of 'em. Tender, marinated meat - cooked to perfection. No large, cornfed slabs, but nice, and sensually sliced. For the grateful diner (as opposed to the glutton). We added a $3 bowl of coconut rice to go w/the dishes, and it was perfect. Surprisingly generous portions all around. We even had leftovers to take home. And for the record, them leftovers are also bomb. Leah is killin' it - congrat's lady!!
12600	71	4.0	1	2013-02-13	"Whenever my drinks are served to me in a young coconut shell, I'm happy. Pig and Khao is a skinny spot on Clinton street at the corner of Rivington.  After a gym session and a v-day prep trip to Babeland, I could only top off a perfect Tuesday night by joining my friends for Fillipino Thai treats.  I had no idea I was such a fan of Fillipino flavors - but after Kuma Inn, I wanted to check this out. There are ""snacks,"" small plates and large plates.  Id consider the small plates to be rather large.  Between the 3 of us, we had a snack and 2 small plates, and were completely stuffed.  The sizzling sigsig was awesome, and a food and activity in 1.  They bring out diced pork in a hot pan, topped with an egg and a lime wedge.  You have to mix the egg, distribute it evenly, and squeeze the lime, then pick up the little wedges with chopsticks.  It was absolutely delicious.  The spiced chickpeas aren't much like chickpeas - more like popcorn - and I wasn't in love.  The khao soi, however, was excellent with jasmine rice.  It's a spicy red curry broth, noodles, chicken, vegetables in a large round bowl.  All great stuff. Oh yes, and back to the drink in a coconut.  It's whiskey bitters, coconut water, and a  few other things...and it just tastes like refreshing coconuts.  I could have drank 4."
13896	71	4.0	1	2013-02-13	The restaurant is sleek, modern, tiny, and congested.  It's a little noisy and a little too friendly with the neighbors seated next to you. The nice thing about these tiny little places, is that the eavesdropping is usually fantastic and so is ordering off of other people's tables.   We of course started things off right with a couple of cocktails and some five spice chicharrons with coconut vinegar.  They were fresh, hot, crunchy, spicy, salty... the best.  I had a Michelada, (Genesee beer, P&K sangrita, Thai chili salt) and my friend had the Phuket Punch (Prosecco, grapefruit-cinnamon syrup, and mint), which I determined tasted exactly like applesauce, and we agreed that was not a bad thing at all. Our next course was Grilled Pork Jowl with watermelon, chicharron, toasted rice, lime-chili fish sauce, and herbs.  This dish was so damn near perfect that I dream about it at night.  The pork jowl was grilled perfectly and melted in your mouth as soon as it hit your tongue.  The jowl paired with the sweet, refreshing watermelon, spicy, salty, crunchy chicharrons and the perfect hit of acid from sauce and a little cool cilantro - it was truly amazing.  We practically licked the plate clean! As an entree we ordered the Grilled Curry Lamb Ribs that came with an  a little yogurt sauce, pickled beets, whole wheat roti chapatti.  We also ordered a side of their vegetable of the day, which was some sort of Asian green with a tasty little sauce on it.  These lamb ribs were fantastic!  They were tender, well seasoned and grilled, and not gamy or fatty (which can happen with lamb).  The combination of the meaty smoky lamb, with the cool yogurt, tang of the beets, bitterness of the greens, sweetness of the coconut rice rolled up in that light and delicious roti was amazing! For dessert - yeah, we managed to shovel some more food down our throats - we got the Turon (banana fritter, chocolate sauce, and salted caramel ice cream).  This was probably our least favorite dish of the night.  I mean don't get me wrong, we ate it, but it was lowest on the list.  These were essentially pastry wrapped bananas, like you'd see at any typical Thai restaurant.  Nothing to write home about for sure.  However, I would write home about that salted caramel ice cream, because it was fantastic.  I recommend just ordering a dish of that. At the end of this amazing meal, we definitely felt like pigs and cows... not to be confused with Pig and Khao!  It was excellent, and I am soooooooooooo excited to go back when their garden is open! ordinarylifeextraordinar…
13897	71	4.0	1	2013-02-13	One of the best new-school Asian-fusion restaurants in the city at this point. Many of the dishes are Filipino-inspired, but with influences from around Southeast Asia (for the most part). I've had the entire menu across a couple visits here, and, per the name of the restaurant, I would highly recommend the pork dishes.  Standouts for me included: - Grilled Pork Jowl: wished there was more jowl pieces, but the watermelon offered a nice balance to the dish. and you can't go wrong with chicharron bits! - Sizzling Sisig: nice take on a traditional Filipino dish. one of my top two dishes there! - Crispy Pata: the pork was cooked to perfection. there was no need for the dipping sauces - Quail Adobo: not pork, but just get this. Otherwise, the rest of the menu was very good. I would suggest sitting at the counter and watching Chef Leah Cohen work her magic.
13898	71	1.0	1	2013-02-13	Don't bother working with them for a large party. This is probably the worst experience I've ever had with a venue. First, I was told to confirm my guests and menu. Then I was told that I would need to sign a contract and put down a deposit before they can even reserve.  After I confirmed with my total number of guests, I went over the pricing of the menu on the telephone. It was only then that I was notified of a 5% admin fee. Even then, I was willing to go forward. A day later, I was notified that they made a mistake on their beverage menu and now they want to charge additional $8.00 per person for non-alcoholic drinks for the 2 hours that we will be there. Oh yeah, the best part was that the event coordinator couldn't even bother to spell my name correctly and the new breakdown that she sent me did not reflect the change in # of guests.
13899	71	4.0	1	2013-02-11	I meet up with my friend and his gf for dinner on a chilly Saturday night. They bought the google offer $20 for $40. I was in good company because they are both Filopino. I spent a few bucks across the street waiting for them so my stomach was primed. We waited almost an hour. The guy came around to give us the play by play of the situations. Made sure we had drinks if we wanted and offered us chicarrons (fried pork rinds) to snack on. We ordered the Shanghai rolls, the sigsig, the Pata, the mixed stir fried veggies and couple bowls of coconut rice for us to share together. Overall, everything was great. The sigsig with the egg was great mixed with the rice. The lime squirts helped cut the fattiness of the sigsig. The Pata did not come with the bone which was a letdown but it still tasted well marinated/seasoned. The shanghai rolls I could have done without. The veggies were a nice dish to add some fiber to the meal. My friends shared the hallo hallo but luckily for me I had my own. It did not have any corn like the hallo hallo I'm used to getting at a friend's house. I should not have eaten so many dumplings before dinner. The San Miguels helped forget the calories I ingested that night. Seating is kinda tight but I didn't felt rushed during our dinner service. I would come back in warmer weather. There seems to be a outdoors area in the back.
13900	71	3.0	1	2013-02-07	The $1 miller high lifes during happy hour are great. We had the chickpeas (a good snack to munch on w/ beer), sisig (not impressed), fried oysters (not bad but small and not enough of them), coconut rice (yum!), pork ribs (really good - falling off the none and flavorful), and market veg (so-so). I had the michelada (pretty good kick but lost its punch halfway through) and my cousin had the coconut drink which was good for trying just once. All in all a chill place and a repeat if I'm I'm the area and want somewhere easy to go to.
13901	71	5.0	1	2013-02-06	The food was great, cool vibes and cheap beers!
13902	71	4.0	1	2013-02-05	I am Filipino and have a very hard time finding Filipino/ Filipino Fusion restaurants that I truly enjoy.  My mom is amazing in the kitchen and whatever I try tends to be disappointing compared to hers.  That being said, even after making a number of mistakes that night I did enjoy my experience at Pig & Khao.   My first mistake was that I went with a friend who tends to be very picky when it comes to food.  We had to immediately eliminate a portion of the menu.  We ended up ordering the Cabbage, the Khao Soi, the Grilled Sirlion and the Sisig (only after convincing her that we had to try at least one adventurous dish).  These dishes were all very good but the Khao Soi was the stand out for me. The next mistake of the night came when we took our server's advice and ordered the Lamb instead of the Green Mango Salad.  He told us that this would not be too much food and since so many people on Yelp complained about portions we went with the larger dish, which was also his favorite dish on the menu.  The lamb was overcooked and I wasn't a fan of the flavors on this.  The roti that accompanied this was also very dry.  I also suffered from food envy when the Green Mango Salad came out for the table next to ours.   The restaurant is very small and currently does not take reservations.  Be prepared for how close you will be to other diners.  I am definitely coming back to try some of the dishes they ordered.  Just with a more adventurous dining companion.
13903	71	4.0	1	2013-02-04	Skipped the large plates on my visit for two and ended up just getting small plates to munch on to go with out drinks. The Sizzling Sisig was amazing. It reminded me of a upgraded traditional Taiwanese dish I used to have at home. Make sure to have it with some coconut rice though as it is very flavorful and savory. The Quail Adobo and the Grilled Pork Jowl were good but not terribly interesting. As for drinks, make sure to get the PX Puko, a blend of coconut water, sherry, whiskey bitters that comes in a freaking coconut with a stick of sugar cane to boot. Absolutely fantastic
13904	71	4.0	1	2013-02-03	This place is dope. Also, $1 beer (miller high life) for happy hour, I am a happy customer by the time I get seated. I do have to say, I thought we were getting snarky comments thrown our way as we were waiting for a while for the remainder of our party to get here but I'll look past it because when we got seated, the service was impeccable. On to the food....WOW. We got the sig sig, which was undeniably the best dish they have. Super flavorful and really kicked me in the flavor buds! It's this greasy, ooey-gooey hot sizzling plate of pork face with an egg on-top that all melts in your mouth. We also went ahead and got some curry noodles which was nutty and what I expected, good, but nothing so special. The whole fish was also a-maz-ing. It came in some sort of broth that closely resembled Tom Yum soup and the fish was decently sized enough for 5 people to nibble at. We order the coconut rice which was flavorful and not so overpowering which was great and I believe that was it. This place is a power-house of flavors! I thoroughly enjoyed it! Also, on a side note, we had an amazing hostess/waitress. She was a young girl that really went above and beyond. No one was using the outdoor bar section in the back and since we were waiting for our party we asked if we could drink beers in the back and she cleaned the entire back in a matter of minutes, recommended some awesome 80's r&b and was just an overall delight! Kudos!
13905	71	4.0	1	2013-02-02	Oh, sizzling sisig, how are you so so good - spicy, delectable, fatty and totally fun?  Paired with a most magical bowl of coconut rice, the meal is just about the most delightful and delicious thing ever. Pig face = my face ! Yay !
13906	71	3.0	1	2013-01-28	The salmon skin chips are delicious and really make me wish I could find them more often. The coconut rice was great too, but that's great everywhere you can find it so it's honestly not that special. But then the sirloin was only okay - a little too salty without the side cabbage, and the lamb ribs were good at first but overwhelmingly fatty. As everyone else has already mentioned, they serve Hitachino beer and they serve it in a bowl, which is pretty unique I suppose. I think I would come again, but I'd skip the lamb ribs.
13907	71	3.0	1	2013-01-25	Gotta say, this place did not wow me. Where to begin? First off, I'm Filipino. And speaking as a Filipino, I usually prefer the more authentic/down and dirty Filipino restaurants, places where you know the lola is cooking in the kitchen.  I can let it slide with some Filipino restaurants that like to mix it up and take it 'new school' like Pig and Khao and Maharlika.  However, I didn't get the vibe this place was 'on it.' For starters, the place is a bit tight, I'm thinking maybe 40 people, tops, including the bar counter tops by the kitchen. There's really no room to squeeze by between tables. Second, the menu was a bit limited. No lumpia? No pancit? Was this restaurant a Filipino restaurant or not?  Third, I did feel a little rushed. There were people waiting by the front for a table and you can tell the establishment is hoping you finish up your meal so they can 'flip it' for the next patrons. We couldn't even finish our drinks at our table, we decided to finish the drinks over by the kitchen as a courtesy to the establishment. The meal overall wasn't all that. The lamb was a bit greasy, the quail adobo was smaller portion than I imagined. The spicy fried oyster and the michelada was ok. Not sure I will be back.
13908	71	4.0	1	2013-01-25	Let me preface this by saying that this review is really more like a 4.5 My friend and I came here to catch after our original plans for eating at Ippudo were squashed by the almost 2 hour wait. I'm glad we ended up coming here though. Overall the food was really good and the atmosphere lively, but not too loud (for me at least). Over the course of our dinner we had the fried oysters (a special for the evening), market veggies (bok choy in oyster sauce), khao soi (a tiny bit too salty for my liking, but overall really good), and a side of rice. Everything was tasty. As there was a long wait time between the oysters and khao soi, they even bought out a place plate of curried cod, which also tasted great. I can't wait to come back and try the chickpeas, pickled cabbage, and fried fish (whole fish in a stew like broth). Positive note: They are very willing to adapt menu items per dietary restrictions. Although we ended up ordering the special instead, I indicated that I really wanted to try the mussels, but that I don't eat any red meat (the mussels are cooked with a pork sausage). They said that they had no problems cooking the dish without the sausage, should I want to have it the next time I come in. My only real 2 critiques would be the description of the size of the dishes and the minimal dessert options (I really love dessert). There is a huge disparity between what qualified as a snack, small dish, or large dish. Some small dishes seemed like snacks, while others were more like large dishes rather than small. Not a huge issue, but confusing when going there for the first time. As for the dessert options, there are only 2. One of which is halo-halo (awesome). Can't remember the other. While not bad, I think one more option would be perfect. Overall though, I came. I ate. I left happy. (and plan to return soon)
13909	71	5.0	1	2013-01-25	Got here a little early (around 6:30pm) on a Thursday night and it wasn't busy at all. We decided to sit at the counter, which was great since it allowed us to watch the cooks in action (and definitely made us want to come back and try everything!). We got the chicharron chips, the special snack that day and it came real fast and was really spicy and tasty (and the coriander soda I got it with was really amazing). Then the crispy rice salad, which you have to wrap in lettuce, very nice (a little too spicy maybe? It was on the verge of hiding the flavors). Then, as many people had mentioned the sizzling sisig, we got it (also we saw other people get it and it looked very good) and it did not disappoint! Really excellent and fun! For desert, we got the special, a Thai iced tea ice cream sandwich. Beyond the fact that is was very cute and very nicely put, it was absolutely amazing. The buns were hot and delicious and the ice cream was melty and tasty. A real treat! We loved it. I noticed that some people complained about the service. We didn't have to wait so I cannot tell how accurate their predictions of waiting time are, but everyone was extremely nice and attentive to us. My friend has a ton (and I'm not exaggerating) of allergies which has made going to asian restaurants a nightmare for him, but everyone (from the waitress to the chef) was extremely careful in making sure everything would go fine. They were also very friendly. The place is very small but nice and the music was great. Definitely a new landmark for us!
13910	71	5.0	1	2013-01-25	"One word: innovative.  My husband and I got off work ""early"" and decided last minute to try out this restaurant.  Got there around 7:45 and were seated immediately.  We chose the bar so we could watch them cook. Everything from food to drink to service was perfectly executed.  We ordered the Khao Soi and coconut rice, the Crispy Curry Rice Salad, and Quail Adobo.  Flavors were a unique fushion of various south asian.  Everything was perfectly overcooked and spiced.   I would highly recommend the P&K cocktail, which in the waitress's words is ""their version of manhattan.""  A bit sweet for my tastes on its own but paired with some of the spicier dishes it was perfect for relieving the heat. Also would highly recommend sitting at the bar.  It's fun to watch them smoke and grill various meats."
13911	71	4.0	1	2013-01-23	My husband and I went to Pig and Khao for dinner a few Sundays ago on a whim and had a really good time.  Reviews on Yelp seem to be so-so, but we were impressed by the food and the service.  Of the dishes we tried, I would recommend the crispy red curry rice salad (totally delicious and spicy) and the sizzling sisig (wonderfully, fatty, porky goodness).  We also tried the whole fried fish and the market vegetables, which were both good but didn't quite live up to the crispy red curry rice salad and the sisig.  The lemongrass broth with the whole fried fish was very nice and the fish was nicely cooked, it just couldn't quite compete with the flavors of the other dishes.  I want to go back again and try the khao soi (the table next to us ordered it and said that it was very spicy but very good) and the grilled pork jowl.   As far as the service goes, I thought everyone was very nice and very helpful.  Our waiter was really great at suggesting how much food we needed for the two of us and steering us towards a balance of spicy and not spicy dishes.  Some of his suggestions ended up being really good ones.  The food came out pretty quickly and was accompanied by instructions as necessary, which I thought was a nice touch.
13912	71	4.0	1	2013-01-22	Came here with a friend on a Wednesday night after we found out the wait at Mission Chinese was over 2 hours.   The wait was approximately 20 minutes, and we ordered a couple of drinks while we waited.  Friend got the PX Puko drink, which was served in a large coconut, so the photo ops made the wait time fly by.   Spicy Pickled Cabbage - was ok, a bit too acidic for me, but the same as you would find anywhere else. Sizzling Sisig - this was the hit of the night.  We had this with the coconut rice, and the combination of the sweet rice, salty pork with the crunchy cheek bits and soft fatty pieces was heavenly.  My tastebuds were going through too many emotions to describe. Mussels - mussels were cooked well, and the fried mantou was good, but the sauce was underwhelming.  It needed a bit more flavor, perhaps more thai basil and garlic?   In the end, what really is going to bring me back is their meat dishes and the service.  Everyone was very friendly and courteous.  They continued to come around to ask if everything was ok, so we felt really well taken care of.  I am definitely coming back for the Lamb.
13913	71	5.0	1	2013-01-21	"Loved it! Showed up at 7pm on MLK Jr. Day (a Monday) and the restaurant wasn't crowded at all. We were offered the choice of sitting at a table and ordering à la carte, or sitting at the bar and doing the tasting menu (a Monday-Wednesday option, we were told). After checking out the menus, we chose the tasting menu and weren't disappointed. My boyfriend started with a Vietnamese coffee (""best coffee i've ever had for $3) and I started with the Phuket Punch (very good, the winter spices are so tasty). Maybe it was because it was a quiet night at the restaurant, but the manager/in-charge-guy asked if he could try out a few wine pairings on us. Sure! Anyways, the food: Fried Oysters: The batter was very crispy and the dipping sauce, a lime-y vinegar-y concoction, was great and tangy.  Paired really well with a few sips of sherry (never thought I'd say that). Banana-leaf Cod: Best dish of the night. It was a great piece of cod and the green/yellow curry that it was served with was so so good and the right type of spicy. Paired well with a riesling. Sirloin Beef with Noodles:  Really nice cuts of beef in a very simple broth with noodles, star fruit, mint, and crispy shallots. Very simple and clean tastes compared to the curry that came with the cod. On it's own, as a dish, it could use something to punch it up. But it was good as a follower to the curry and a predecessor to the... BBQ Ribs:  Whoa. Loved. The basting sauce was really flavorful and the meat was a little crispy and very tender. The portion was also very large... two big ribs. Paired with a Filipino beer, which really hit the spot. Ice cream sandwich: I was still in a coma from the ribs, so I barely heard what the dessert was. I think it was a thai tea ice cream between two donut/cookie type things. Very refreshing and a great way to wrap the meal. We also had two other cocktails: the Clinton Cooler (refreshing and light) and the PX Puko (sweet, but good) Service was great, everyone was very nice and attentive. I'm a huge fan of sitting in front of an open kitchen (much to the suffering of my dinner conversation). Leah Cohen, the Top Chef alum and head chef, was cooking about 2 feet away the entier meak, but we mostly interacted more with her sous chef while she chatted up two people she seemed to know well at the other end of the counter. We'll be back for sure!"
13914	71	5.0	1	2013-01-21	Creative, innovative, enticing and just plain delicious.  This is what makes visiting NYC an incredible culinary experience.  Your not going to find this in the suburbs.  Well worth the trip to the bustling lower east side and well worth the wait.  Especially loved the curry lamb ribs which just falls off the bone.
13915	71	5.0	1	2013-01-20	Pig and Khao, with its open kitchen, is a vibrant restaurant which does not cost an arm and a leg. The food is very sophisticated, creative and, more importantly, extremely delicious. It is evident that much thought and intelligence went into every dish bringing Filipino and Thai food to a whole new level. Pig and Khao is an excellent culinary experience. Talk about getting the most bang for your buck! Check it out for yourself and you will see what I mean. And have fun.
13916	71	3.0	1	2013-01-17	Since it is a small restaurant there is usually a wait -- while you wait I recommend you get the PX PUKO drink (it comes in a cute little coconut and is very tasty) - KHAO SOI - pretty darn good (it was my favorite dish) - Grilled Sirloin - good but the issan sauce was too spicy (my friends didn't even use it) - Crispy Red Curry Rice Salad - it was alright (my friends thought it was a bit too spicy but i thought it was just right)
13917	71	2.0	1	2013-01-16	I had high hopes for this hole in the wall restaurant. For me, something about finding places like this piques my interest. The menu does have many items that seem enticing. being 8 people, we ordered a wide array of things(apologies I don't remember any of the items) there seemed to be a common issue with the food--we found a lot of the food salty. Having rice with the courses helps a great deal but I couldn't bring myself to think that any one dish left me wanting another bite. Though the food isn't horrid--still, I don't think I'll go out of my way to come here again.
13918	71	3.0	1	2013-01-14	Let me start off with a disclaimer that I am not a huge fan of Filipino food to begin with. Arrived here on a Sunday night and was seated right away.  The place has a chic ambiance that is common in Manhattan Asian fusion restaurants - dim lighting, dark earthly colors, and an open kitchen so that smells permeate the entire place, which isn't large. We had three small plates plus a bowl of rice.  The Chinese sausage salad was nice with sweet fatty sausage complementing the salty fish sauce all on a bed of lettuce.  The pork jowl was new for me and I am not a fan.  It was similar to the salad except had watermelon which was nice.  But it also came with pork rinds (yuck!) and the jowl itself was pretty fatty, which if that's how it's suppose to be, I probably won't be getting again. The highlight was the sizzling sisig.  This was recommended by the waitress and she was right.  Pork pieces came on a hot iron with an egg on top.  The strong salty and sweet of the meat complemented the fragrant coconut rice that we ordered.  Definitely get this dish as it is their speciality. Negative stars for poor service.  Perhaps it was this particular waitress but she almost spilled salad juice on me, forgot our order, and didn't really see to us for the rest of the meal.  Also, I was hoping to be served the three small plates together rather than sequentially.  We got the bowl of rice at the end which would have been appreciated throughout the meal.
13919	71	1.0	1	2013-01-13	"I'm really turned off by my experience here last night.  I've been raving about this place to many of my friends lately so last night three of us went in.  At 8:15 we went in, put our name down and was told the wait would be 45min-hour.  I gave them my # and we went across the street for a drink while we waited.  Well, an hour & a half later we get called our table will be ready.... No joke, 45 minutes after that we were sat making the grand total wait time at 2 hours and 15 minutes! What?!   Strike 1 & 2: Inappropriate and VERY incorrect wait time both before we showed up after being called and before. While we sat for 45 minutes waiting for our table the host & waiter were very nice but negligent.  We had to wait like 15 minutes for our bottle of wine and then when offered an app, we assumed it was comped due to our 2 hour wait and said yes.  I mean at this point an app or round of drinks should be free, right?  Finally we are seated, order food, everything is delicious although the Khao Soi is so spicy that perhaps it could have come a bit earlier - not as the last dish.  Anyway, now it is almost midnight because instead of a 9pm dinner, we started at 10:30.  My friends ask for two more glasses of wine and the waiter has the audacity to tell us they are closing in 10 minutes. WHAT?!  Needless to say, we asked if that meant we had to leave, he said no and we got our wine.  This was the first time we were even remotely rude all night even though we were pretty annoyed. Strike 3:  Really dude?  We waited an extra hour + 15 minutes over your estimation of an hour and you are going to tell us we have to leave prior to being closed? Finally - the last straw.  Our bill comes.  NOTHING is comped and the appetizer (""snacks"") we were offered while waiting is actually on the bill.  Really Pig & Khao, it's $4. We  can afford it, but like....really?  P.S. - the ""snacks"" here are actually not that amazing...they do not live up to the rest of the menu. The wait staff was friendly, a bit apologetic and the food is great but this was just ridiculous. My friends and I were honestly shocked and won't be going back."
12654	71	2.0	1	2013-01-13	Came here last Friday night around 8:30 pm and waited 20 min. for a table - not too bad. The grilled pork jowl was good. I liked all the different elements of the dish and they worked well together. Everything after this was a disappointment. The sizzling sisg tasted mainly like fat and oil. Probably should have noticed that the 2 tables on either side of ours had ordered the same dish and hadn't finished theirs. The khao soi was REALLY SPICY! my friend and i basically took one bite each and then downed our glasses of water. our waiter seemed to notice that we weren't enjoying this dish -- or rather, that it was essentially untouched. When we explained our problem, he was nice enough to take it off our check and suggest we order something. We tried the crispy pata, but this dish basically just tasted like the pork jowl and sizzling sisig (I mean, we're basically eating different fried parts of the same pig...). Maybe we should have made an effort to order more variety, rather than what everyone had raved about. It's probably not good when I found the most memorable part of the meal to be the coconut rice.
13920	71	5.0	1	2013-01-05	"I was there with my fiancé and 3 year old daughter!!!!   It was the most amazing exotic food that I ever had!!!!   Staff are super friendly!!!!   Love the cocktail drink ""coconut"",,,,      Please get this drink!!!!!!   I will be back next week!!!!"
13921	71	5.0	1	2013-01-02	We must have hit it up on a good day. Three of us were seated at a great table immediately! The food was deliciously spiced - especially our whole fried fish. I could have bathed in the broth. Thank god we ordered coconut rice to sop it up later on. My recommendation is to ask your server what's best for the day - they never steer you wrong. And, don't leave without one of their signature cocktails. I cannot wait to return. I absolutely loved it.
5430	71	4.0	1	2012-12-22	"Split 4 tapas between three girls- which was a mistake because each Tapa was pretty huge and there was more than enough to go around. We were so stuffed at the end, but we still managed to squeeze in some halo halo for dessert. Out of the 4 tapas we had I recommend: 1)pork jowl- it was quite tasty the saltness of the pork was balanced by the citrus of the watermelon 2) Mussels- Mussels were in some curry type broth and there were little pieces of chinese sausage which made it so interesting to eat. The sisig was actually disappointing- there was too much fat in it,  quail adobo had flavor but they just reminded me of small miniature pieces of fried chicken. and also the food is served in chinese plates which I thought was a little odd, but i guess it serves the purpose of making the presentation more humble and to give it a  ""home cooked"" meal feel"
13922	71	4.0	1	2012-12-16	I was very excited to visit because I've heard a lot of hype about it.  We ordered one snack item and 4 small plates and they were all pretty amazing!  I would recommend the Pig Jowl has such an interesting flavor with the mix of watermelon and citrus and the sisig, which is a definite must as well.   The server we had was great at the beginning with giving recommendations but as the night went on, she kind of forgot about our last dish and we were left hanging for a good 30 mins before we flagged her down and she realized she didn't place the order for our last dish. Food is definitely very good here, but the fact that it's an open kitchen and there's a lot of heavy cooking going on, my clothes all smelled like the restaurant.
13923	71	4.0	1	2012-12-13	This spot is very hipsteresque. Top Chef Leah Cohen was there giving orders to the crew. The service is good. My water was top off every time it was at half. The waitress explained the small menu in detail and gave recommendations. My friend appreciated because she hates spicy food. We ended up ordering the sizzling sisig, green mango salad, and the mussels. I loved everything! (Beware Filipino is on the greasy side so don't go bad mouthing these ppl.) Sizzling Sisig was my fave. It comes out with a raw egg but the iron plate is so hot that you stir alil and it will cook. It had a nice spice to it. They brought out each dish on its own which I liked because I love hot food. Although the portions are called small dishes. We were really full after the three dishes. Oh I loved the playlist...mostly hip hop :) Hmmm would I change anything? Maybe adding a couple more dishes? Enjoy.
13924	71	5.0	1	2012-12-09	Awesome & Awesome.
13326	71	3.0	1	2012-12-07	"For this review I will be co-opting the vocabulary of another Yelper: Rolled up in dis dope resto wit my boyz Evan R.eFlex and Garrett ""Tha General"" P for some serious hoggin and not like da kind a hoggin you do when you lose a bet. All kinds a bishes on dates and legit ""cocktails."" For some reason their drinks ain't got real liquor so I couldn't get my usual grey goose and mountain dew. The colada was off the muhfuggin hookunut so I ordered two of em.

13925	71	3.0	1	2012-12-05	hmmmmm....where to start, where to start...Well I finally made it here last night with my monthly supper club. Pig and Khao was on our list, albeit pretty far down and our original reservation was for WD50 down the street but alas, it's the holidays which translates to: holiday shopping + a penchant for expensive shoes + wall street lifers no longer seeing bonuses = a bunch of broke supper club members. As we wiped away tears while passing WD50, sniff, we found ourselves at our destination and basically the only people there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night; not looking good. We snagged a table right away, obviously and ordered a few starters because we were starving. I was excited for the fried chick peas, Tia Pol in Chelsea does these fabulously. Our waitress, who was lovely, also suggested a special snack which was chicarones, fried pig skin. The chick peas were a let down, damn you Tia, you've ruined me for ever finding the equivalent! The chicarones were good, dipped in some vinegar, but they were greasy. I mean how could they not be? I felt like I needed a grape soda, anyone southern will get that last line. For drinks we went with a bottle of red, bottle of white....no Billy Joel accompaniment. Since they basically stock 2 reds and 2 whites we went with the Pinot Blanc and the Pinot Noir. Pinot Blanc good, Noir, not so much. On to the food. Cucumber and tomato salad: Chinese sausage, toasted rice, shallot, coriander, lime-fish sauce, bibb lettuce. I think the idea here is to create not so healthy lettuce wraps, which we did and they were good. Again, the theme here is fried and unhealthy. Next up, crispy red curry rice salad,minced pork, crispy garlic, shallot, sawtooth coriander, ginger, peanuts, lime-fish sauce and boy did this have a kick. Well done!  We had to try the SIZZLING SISIG as it is their signature dish. If you can get around what it is and find the actual pieces of meat instead of fat this is another tasty dish.  For large plates we ordered the crispy pata and the whole fried fish. The pata was good  and the whole fish was excellent. I'm a big fan of whole fish and the hot and sour sauce and really all the flavors worked very well. The one Filipina in our group has a shellfish allergy which prevented her from partaking in this dish. It was quite a shame as it was probably the best dish. We had a great time, we could be as loud as we wanted to be and our waitress was tres cool. The fact that the above mentioned club member was not impressed, and let's face it these are her peeps, led me to believe Pig and Khao was a bit of a let down. Bummer. For 5 of us with the above mentioned orders, it came to $50 a person, tip included. Was that bad? No, but was it worth it? meh, the jury's still out.
13926	71	4.0	1	2012-11-29	Basically, everything was FRIED. It was all delicious, but really, I was hopping for more variety of cooking styles. But perhaps most Filipino food is fried and I'm just none the wiser. I was a big fan of the coconut rice and the sizzling sisig. The salmon chips were also delicious but a bit saltier than I'd hoped. There's a fun garden area in the back (too cold for us when we went) that has all you can drink beer for $15 (go pour it yourself from the tap). It's a small restaurant but in a great area for bar hopping afterwards.
13927	71	2.0	1	2012-11-29	I appreciate the effort...I really do. But after spending close to $400 and trying every dish on the menu, I'm thoroughly unimpressed. There wasn't one that blew me away or that I'd come back for. It felt more like food / flavor adventurism (all the rage on cable tv these days). Pig head, jowl, salmon chips...all a huge 'pass' for me.
13928	71	2.0	1	2012-11-20	The food was great.  Crispy Red Curry Salad and Khoi Soi were awesome.  The all you can drink beer was a struggle with the keg flowing bad and serving plenty of foam.  The bar backs and bartenders were great and figured it out and kept bringing me beers.   I wish i could have tipped just them.  The waitress was awful.  She obviously wanted to leave and was rushing us through our meal at 9:45pm on a Tuesday.  She was late to something.  She kept trying to pick up our plates.  I had to take it out of her hands at one point to stress i wasn't done.    I read this article from the GM about customers not being a dick to get good service.  He should realize that not being a dick should start with his own wait staff !! blogs.villagevoice.com/f…
13929	71	4.0	1	2012-11-20	We went to Pig and Khao around 8pm last Saturday as a group of 4. They don't take reservations, which is kind of a bummer, but the space is small, so understandable. The wait wasn't too bad- maybe around 30 minutes. There's a cute outdoor space in the back where you can wait if the front is too crowded, though they don't have heat lamps... The menu skewed towards Filipino rather than Thai, though I am sure there is a bit of an overlap. My husband is Filipino, and we've tried quite a few Filipino places around NY (Café 81, Maharlika, Engeline's, etc.) and this one is a nice chic alternative in line in vibe and price with Maharlika. Cute space, not overly decorated. We ordered: The Fried Chickpeas: Yummy, crunch and addictive. Crispy Rice Salad: Surprisingly spicy. Nice texture with the crunchy fried rice bits. Green Mango Salad: Yum. Just like Som Tam. Nice contrast to the fatty dished Watermelon and Pork Jowl salad: Delish. Similar to the watermelon salad at Fatty Crab. Sizzling Sisig: Nice and fatty. The parts they used weren't too obscure. Khao Soi: Nice standard curry dish. Crispy pata: Came pre-cut, which was nice. We had the Phuket Punch (more or less a tart wine spritzer? Good, though) and Micheladas for drinks. The only complaint was the bar was backed up (just one bartender) and so the drinks took a long time to get to our table. They recommended that we do about 5- 6 small plates and two large format plates. Let me tell you that it was a ton of food despite us getting 5 small plates and just one large format plate. We didn't even get to the halo halo! Oh ps, if you're not into pork of all kinds of on a diet, maybe you should skip this place. Though you're missing out on LIFE.
13930	71	4.0	1	2012-11-19	"Hong Kong Style? Not to be confused with Shaolin style, apparently the large volume beers (Get the Nest Owl, DO IT!) come with the option of drinking it out of a bowl. I pictured a Pho bowl, but sadly it was only a rice bowl. If you like drinking sake out of wooden boxes, mead out of ox horns, or wine out of comically large and ornate goblets, then this may be the option for you. Our party of 5 was lucky to grab a table within 5 minutes of arriving on a Friday night. I'm sure as the word gets out, that may change but the host said people can kill time in one of the neighboring bars. Our group decided to try several of P&Ks Thai/Filipino offerings. The salmon chips were a little too fishy for my taste and I don't mind fish sauce. If you're not a fan of anchovies, then I'd skip it. We also tried 3 small plates, the sisig, quail wings, and pork jowls. I'd recommend any of these 3. The sisig was really tasty. I've had this dish at other places and this one had better spicing than the other ones I've had. The other places were really heavy on the fat content and really required a large amount of rice to balance out the richness. P&K blends the right amount of fattiness with savory meat. We had to order two of the quail wings and they were pretty good. They arrived coated in an adobo sauce and depending on your chop stick skills, you may get a little messy eating them. They had a nice garlic and soy flavor to them. The pork jowls dish with chicharrons tasted really good with its blend of watermelon, cilantro and fish sauce. The sweetness of the watermelon, worked well with the savory/sweet of the fish sauce and jowls plus the saltiness of the chicharrons. The Chinese parsley added the right amount of ""brightness"" to the whole dish. When it comes to the large plates, the crispy pata had good flavor but it just seemed like there were more bones then shank in my opinion. There was a liver based sauce for dipping that was pretty tasty and should be mentioned. The better dish we had was the curried lamb ribs with roti. People could make their own wraps and add as much or little yogurt and pickled beets to suit their palate. It was a nice experience eating with friends and drinking beer while hip-hop played in the background. There's nothing like munching on a quail wing while Biggie's Notorious thugs or Lil Wayne's Right Above It plays in the restaurant. Don't be surprised to find yourself head bobbing to the beats. Our sever was also gracious enough to split our bill 5 ways as well."
13931	71	4.0	1	2012-11-19	Loving this new wave of Top Chef run / Asian deliciousness that's taking over NYC. Stopped in on a random Tuesday night for a fun dinner. After having got lost about 4 times I finally made it in to the restaurant. The space is cute, small but cozy with Leah around the food bar doing her thing. So between two, the suggest about 3 starting dishes and one large entree - For a snack we started off wit the salmon skin chips - salty and flavorful. The accompanying sauce is good. We had a spicy cabbage slaw sent to our table my mistake so we ended up just keeping it around - but I am glad it wasnt charged on our bill because it just wasnt tasty at all. For starters we had the Khao Soi - defreakinglicious - savory, crispy just warming (a must) as well as the Sizzling Sig Sig - so so so so fragrant another absolutely tasty and wonderful starter. It came out on a hot plate sizzling hot with a runny egg (best combination ever). The grilled pork jowl, I dont know I wanted to like it so much but I just didnt find it to be mind blowing. For our entree we opted for the whole fried fish. The presentation, the sauce, the texture of the fish was wonderful. A little messy to eat on a date but ordering an entire crispy fish means your in the I dont have to wear make up everyday kind of relationship. I definitely say go for it. The cocktails are good out of the three I had that night, I must say that the phuket punch and the RIDICUOUSLY large asahi can will do the job just right. Enjoy and drink uppppppp.
13932	71	3.0	1	2012-11-17	Wow there are so many restaurants to choose from in the LES. This one was pretty nondescript on the outside, slightly hard to find without any signage but once you walk in, the warm smell takes you in immediately. Walked in with no rsvp on a Friday evening and was told that it'd be about a 15-20 min wait for two. We sat in a little corner waiting section and ordered some wine to get comfortable. There's no real selection of alcohol in here--a few different beers, some basic cocktails and a few basic nonspecific wines. Apparently, $15 lets you help yourself to an unlimited amount of beer from a keg somewhere inside, but I didn't indulge. We were sat near the front (was hoping for a seat near the bar so we could watch some of the preparation process) and immediately the hostess handed menus and explained the cod special for the day. She must've given us exactly a minute as she came back shortly after to ask if we were ready. I was slightly irked by the urgency but was ready to order anyway. We opted to go with two small dishes and a large. For the small dishes, we got the cod special and mussels. For our large, we got the crispy pork pata. We also got a side of coconut rice. The mussels were fresh and came in a pretty nice broth which was slightly sweet, acidic and spicy. There were sweet sausages and small bread puffs which were great for absorbing the broth. The cod was cooked in banana leaf and extremely tender. Had a lime/chili/curry type flavoring to it. We devoured it quickly. The pata was pretty damn good. Crispy pieces of pork meat and fat in a light seasoning. The milky coconut rice was a perfect complement to the fatty dish. All in all, good food but the damage was over around $60pp and I would rather spend similar money on a lunch pre-fixe meal at Gramercy Tavern or omakase at Jewel Bako. Service was unmemorable and the vibe was loud/hipster and not very intimate.
13933	71	4.0	1	2012-11-15	I loved the crispy pata! I like the way they removed the bones and extra fat. I like that it doesn't look like what it is - pig's thigh. The sisig was also superb! The salmon skin starter had a nice crisp and the dipping was to die for. don't oder the salmon skin if you are averse to salty food. The mango salad is more Thai and was a great surprise, but a tad bit too salty even for someone that puts fish sauce on everything. Ambience is also nice and warm. Wait staff are cute, friendly, and attentive. The banana turon was not impressive. The banana was overcooked and was soggy. The halo-halo was nice and light, but can't compare it to Razon's in Manila.
13934	71	5.0	1	2012-11-14	Why Come Here? Phenomenal & interesting SE Thai & Filipino fare, lively atmosphere, cheap beer Recommended meal for 2: 3 small plates and a coconut rice Pig and Khao may be my new favorite restaurant in New York City. Let's take a look at the tape: Delicious and interesting riffs on one of my favorite cuisines (SE Asian). Check. Lively atmosphere with sassy waitresses. Check. Unlimited keg beer for $15 with great cocktails for everyone else. Triple Check. Yes, Top Chef contestant Leah Cohen's new restaurant has something for everyone from foodie to frat lord. From what I can tell, there are only two drawbacks. First, the no reservation policy means fairly long waits (expect around an hour at prime times). This is mitigated by the unlimited beer you will drinking and the large outdoor garden you can wait in (for another month at least). Second is the the open kitchen. While I don't mind having my coat smell like bacon for the next week, I can conceive that some of you might. On to the food. The menu is divided into three sections: snacks, small plates and large plates. The snacks consist of fried chickpeas or Russ & Daughters salmon skins and are perfect little bites to share while you wait. The small plates make up the majority of the menu and have a pork focus, as you may have surmised from the restaurant's name. However, there are plenty of suitable options for those who don't eat pork (although I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're a veggie). We had a group of four and did most of our damage on this section, ignoring the pricier large plates.  My recommendations are below, while my thoughts on everything we ate are available on DishEnvy. Green Mango Salad:  Spicy and refreshing, this salad bursts with great Thai flavors. Quail Adobo:  Surprisingly meaty little wings that were sweet, spicy and tangy. Khao Soi: Everything comes together perfectly here: slippery egg noodles, spicy greens and aromatic red curry Mussels:  A very tasty green curry base, but the mantao bun stole the show. Katherine described it as a pretzel meets doughnut and it's perfect for sopping up the curry and all your other sauces as well. Coconut Rice:  What's that you say? It's just rice cooked in coconut milk, how good can it be? Try it and all will be revealed.
13935	71	4.0	1	2012-11-12	Food was great, a nice mix of various Asian cuisines. And all  you can drink deal can't be beat.
13936	71	5.0	1	2012-11-12	The food was awesome. I still don't love Hipster service,  but the food far overshadowed the service. The chef was cooking with a young man who introduced himself to us as Ben. They were having fun and it showed in the food. Great flavors, great prices, and the Crispy Pata was off the charts great. This is truly a don't miss kinda place!! Yum!
13937	71	3.0	1	2012-11-05	I came back to experience this place on a regular night - M suggested inoteca and I am sorry but that is the last place where I would like to eat. I suggested Pig and Khao instead, so M and I got there and staff there are super laid back. So it could be bad or good - depending how you like your service to be. I forgot to say - love the old school jams here, too bad this is a restaurant and not a place for dancing. I got the Cilantro and Lime Soda - really good. M got the Young coconut - love the taste of this...really good. M and I got red wine - M got the Pinot Noir and I got the Tempernallio? I love Salmon Skin in Japanese restaurant, so naturally when I saw Salmon Skin chips - I was like M, I am really curious about this and so we got it. Both of us were like....ummmm really really fishy. I ate more than M, just because I felt bad for picking this appetizer and it was really disgusting. Totally doesn't taste like freaking salmon skin in Japanese restaurant. DO NOT ORDER THIS DISH - the dipping sauce was too much too and it didn't save this dish. Pork Jowl - this was my favourite dish. It reminded me of the duck salad I get, but this is just with Pork jowl. M loved it too. Khao Soi - M doesn't like curry, but I said all curry aren't the same and M should try this dish, since I was craving some noodles. This was good, but I still love the pork jowl. We didn't get dessert, just because it was cold and I couldn't do ice cream.
13938	71	4.0	1	2012-10-27	Went here a few nights ago. If you like spice this is the place for you.  Although they make sure to find out your spice tolerance before you order. We ordered the cucumber salad with sausage which was a good start. The sizzling pork sisig is probably my favorite with coconut rice. Ordered red curry rice dish which was ok, little too crunchy.  Atmosphere was nice. Tables are a little close together but it's NYC so that's normal. Waitress was very good and knowledgeable. I'll def go back.
13939	71	5.0	1	2012-10-23	We ate at Pig and Khao just a few weeks after it opened and it is officially my new favorite LES restaurant.  I admit, being the creepily huge Top Chef fan that I am, Leah Cohen was 80% of the reason I made the trek from the UWS (the unlimited beer constituted the other 20%.) I was definitely not disappointed.  I went with my husband and two friends so we were able to order a couple of different dishes and drinks.  There was not one thing we tried that we would not happily pay to eat again. From beginning to end.... The atmosphere: Fun, trendy, and sure, maybe a little hipster.  We ate outside so most of all it was roomy, if not a little lonely.  There's no music, fewer people, no opportunity to see the cooking process (which is out in the open in the main room.)  Outside definitely has a much different vibe; it almost feels like a different restaurant.   It's also where everyone else comes to fill up on their unlimited beer so in some ways, it kind of feels like your restaurant is in the backyard of a frat house.  I think I would prefer to eat inside next time, The meal: Quail Adobo: delicious and well-cooked.  Our friends were a little hesitant about quail (they're not quite as adventurous eaters as we) but everyone loved it and the accompanying sauces. We were fighting over the last leg Pork Jowl: this was by far the dish I was looking forward to the most but did not end up being my favorite of the night.  Tasty.  The watermelon was a nice balance to the chicharron and lime sauce but I agree with the reviewer who said it reminded them too much of a salad. Khao Soi: The hit of the night!  Borders just on the edge of being almost too spicey but this  was hands down everyone's favorite dish.  We devoured every last drop of this soup until there as nothing left and then seriously debated ordering another bowl Crispy Pata: we ordered this based on a review we read and were not disappointed.  Very hard to share - as in, I did not want anyone else to have a single bit.  The pork was sooooo tender and perfectly cooked and the crispy outside was a whole treat on its own. We were all so blown away by the meal that we didn't want it to end so we ordered not one, but both of the desserts.   We got both desserts because I really wanted the Turon (banana fritter with salted caramel ice cream and chocolate sauce) while everyone else wanted the halo halo.  I admit, the halo halo was good - it was light, non-filling, and complex in flavor - but the Turon was out of this world.  Seriously, I dream about it at night.  Everyone else pretty much agreed too. Overall, the atmosphere was fun, the food was great, and if that's not enought - bottomless beer.
13940	71	3.0	1	2012-10-22	I liked the food here, but I wasn't a huge fan. They have some specialty brews by the bottle, and as others have mentioned, there is a $15 all you can drink beer option. I ordered a can of stout. Was good. Can't remember the brand, it was some kind of microbrew. Shared a few dishes: pig's jowl (gellatinous texture, tasty if you're into it; I like it, but not sure it's everyone's taste), quail adobo (best dish of the night; very well seasoned, cooked nicely), curry noodles (slow heat that builds; didn't realize it was quite that spicy and I was glad to have my glass of stout handy), a crispy pata (roast pork) dish (unmemorable, came with a liver pate that was good), and a beef dish (unmemorable, was a bit dry). everything was tasty, but nothing I would really crave after having it. coconut rice was overcooked and slightly too mushy for my taste. Didn't have any of the desserts; a filipino friend we were eating with had tried two options in a previous meal and didn't like their version of the halo halo, so we went elsewhere for sweets.
13941	71	5.0	1	2012-10-18	"tip:  get the sizzling sisig!  sit at the bar!  $15 all you can drink beer! my favorites were the sizzling sisig and the coconut rice.  its going to be hard to try the rest of the menu...  bc i am going to be so tempted to order this all the time!  i like the whole set up.  ""garden"" area in the back, bar you can watch top chef alum leah cohen do her thing, and table dining.   very chill atmosphere... prob a great place to host a small to medium sized party."
13942	71	5.0	1	2012-10-18	"This place is destined for greatness and thus, I am deeming this as my go-to place whenever I am in the area! ""Holy Khao"", damn straight it's good. And it's only 4 weeks young (as of 10/18/12)!! Great ambience. Hipster, yes. They also have great music playing in the background while you eat. Sat on the counter. Saw the wonderful chef work it, dazzling and sprinkling things here and there onto the plates. I ended up getting 2 small plates (Pork Jowl and Sizzling Sisig) and coconut rice. Each small tapas range from $13-16 and the coconut rice was $3. The coconut rice is a MUST have! Thankfully they brought the meals one at a time so that we could both share the meal without it going cold on us. First got the Pork Jowl. Right amount of spice and sweetness to it. I wonder what it was. The server said it was ""thai suet?"" but I have my doubts that it was. Whatever it was, it was great. I even thought that they didn't need to serve the plate with the crispy chicharron and they still would have had a great plate. The chicharron was a nice addition though. Next was the Sizzling Sisig with a side order of the coconut rice. OMG, must, must, must, must have. Comes out on a hot frying pan, and with an egg over it. Mix the egg with the rest and Holy Khao, it's an absolute winner. I will definitely be coming to this place more often. Even might go here over cocoron which is nearby even with the weather getting colder. Also on a side note: There's an ""all you can drink"" option here at $15/pp. Currently they are serving Miller High Life. Keep that in mind if y'all wanna eat and drink cheap! ----------- 10/29 Update: Girlfriend and I have been here a couple more times, and then she went HAM and brought everyone here without me a couple more times after that. This is our consensus... STILL AMAZZZIIIIINGGGGG... Yes, Sizzling Sigsig is a STILL def with the coconut rice. Never ceases to fail. Khao Soi - It is a DELICIOUS Thai curry with noodles. There is also crispy noodles in it to give that extra crunch. Lots of flavor and love in that thing. I was tempted to order another bowl of coconut rice for the curry after the noodles. Quail Adobo, according to my gf, is good. But nothing really to rave about. I shall update more and more and more as I continue going to this place!"
13943	71	3.0	1	2012-10-18	While it was interesting and a bit different - I didn't love it. A tapa is a tapa is a tapa.  I guess I don't love this type of food maybe.  We tried about 7 or 8 dishes as a group and none of them blew me away.  Several were solid, several were blah. I do appreciate the liter cans of beer - nice touch on that. The staff was nice and the food ok - wouldn't suggest going back but wouldn't try to detere anybody from trying it.
13944	71	4.0	1	2012-10-17	Holy Khao, tapas that I don't hate! Was here on a recent Friday night.  The hostess was nice and let us order some beers while we waited for a table.  Definitely appreciated the beer prices ($3-$6).  The server was helpful in giving us an idea on how many plates a table of 4 guys should be ordering (4-6 small plates plus 1 big plate).  The plates came at perfect intervals as we were never left waiting forever for the next plate to come (as can happen at some tapas places).  The portions were pretty decent for being small plates and was enough for 4 guys to get enough of each plate. My favorite dish had to be the sizzling sisig (pork head).  2nd was probably the pork jowls or the mussels (with chicken sausage, I think).  Great food all around.  And the banana dessert was pretty good.  All in all, a great experience.
13945	71	4.0	1	2012-10-16	"Between some of the Yelp reviews and growing up eating Filipino food, I was preparing myself to have a mediocre meal.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that our dinner turned out to be better than what some others experienced. Sure, some of the Thai and Filipino flavors could have been a little stronger and more present in some of the dishes.  But the flavors were there and tasted pretty good. For two people, we ordered 3 small plates and one large plate. While our waitress said this was the right amount of food, I think two small plates and one large was better for us.  By the third small plate, I was getting full and almost forgot we had one more dish coming.  I wouldn't call the small plates ""tapas"" because they are larger portions than typical tapas. Quail adobo - very tasty and adobo sauce was done nicely.  Quail takes it up a notch and be prepared to use your hands. Mussels - broth was good along with the spicy peppers; mussels were small even though we're in a ""r"" month. Pork jowl - this is refreshing and savory and was glad that chicharron was able to stay a little crispy to provide some texture. I would have liked more fish sauce but can understand it's dialed back to appeal to broader tastes. Crispy Pata - hearty serving and the pork was pretty tender but needs the sauce, which is ok because the liver sauce is good Halo halo - even though we were stuffed, I had to try their version.  It was ok, but I prefer the way my mom makes it One gripe I have is that they charge $3 for a small bowl of rice.  COME ON!! I don't know what's with celebrity chefs going to Asia to learn about Asian cuisine in which rice is a basic staple, and coming back to the U.S. and having the balls to charge.  Ridiculous.  We tried both...the coconut rice was slightly undercooked and didn't knock my socks off. The restaurant took over the old Falai space and changed some decor without a complete remodel.  The ""bar"" is sectioned off in one of the front windows but isn't designed for guest seating; instead you have your drinks in the other front window waiting area."
13946	71	5.0	1	2012-10-15	We sat up at the counter and watched the meat sizzle (smells amazing) and fresh ingredients get placed into several exciting dishes.  We had fish fermented for 4 days that came out crispy and full of flavor.   That was a special that is done once a week.  We had the large plate curry lamb dish that is always on the menu.  It was sort of like a kabob with the lamb cooked perfectly, roti as a shell, pickled beet and a yogurt sauce.  The whole thing does not get soggy and does not fall apart.  That is a major achievement.  Sizzling sisig.    This dish sounds a little scary but is best described as crispy well seasoned pig bits on a cast iron dish.  It is incredible. Prepare to drink beer or wine.  There are enough choices of each and will continue to improve as they have only been open for a short time.
13947	71	4.0	1	2012-10-11	By now if you have read any reviews blah blah Top Chef alum Leah Cohen blah blah Fatty Crew blah blah mixed reviews blah blah I hate it blah blah I love it.  Now a days, it seems there is a celebrity chef around every corner.  Which comes as no surprise with the plethora of competitive chef shows out there.  I have to admit I had no idea about the celebrity status of the restaurant before entertaining an invitation from a friend.   Interestingly enough, I thought Pig and Khao was a play on Pig and Cow, but I don't think there was any bovine meat on the menu.  Regardless, the small dishes are meant to be like tapas style which are great to spread out the flavors.  A favorite was the quail adobo, and the mussels.  Everyone mentions the Crispy Pata, which is a larger dish and with reason.  It was pretty darn good. The service was not as bad as what some of the reviews have said.  In fact, it was not bad at all.  It was rather pleasant.  I suppose Yelp helped roll out the kinks here.  Perfect for a party of 4 or less.  More, then you might run into some difficulty.  There is a nice waiting area in the front if your party hasn't completely arrived.   Like every new start up, the Chef was present.  Leah was looking as cute as ever.  Oh yeah, I had to google it up because I had no idea who she was.  Food was good, service was serving, and Leah being the princess of Pig and Khao.
13948	71	5.0	1	2012-10-07	Everything was delicious but my favorites were the Sizzling Sisig and Whole Fried Fish. Get the coconut rice on the side to savor all the sauce.
13345	71	3.0	1	2012-10-04	"I was very excited to try this place from the Fatty Crew and Top Chef alum Leah Cohen, and I'm not sure if they are getting their sea legs and need to work out the kinks but I'm not sure its worth all the hype. My friend and I went early to avoid the wait, and was seated at a nice 4 top table outdoors.  We were warned by the host that if another party of two wanted to be seated, we would have to share the table.  Sure no big deal.  Then another staff member took away the plates and cups next to us.  We order a bunch of small plates, prob overdid it, but here we go: First, we get the fried chickpeas.  This is a favorite of ours, and we love the tapas versions at Babbo and at Tia Pol.  They were fried to a crisp so that none of the meal-y texture of the chickpea remained and it was just a ball of crisp.  While anything fried is yum, when compared to this dish in other restaurants, it doesn't hold. We followed this starter with the Green Mango Salad, the Grilled Pork Jowl, the Khao Soi, and was coaxed by our waiter to order the Sizzling Sisig (with rice for $3 extra).   Green Mango Salad - was great.  Thinly julienned green mango with herbs, nicely char broiled chicken on top, with fishy tiny shrimps and roasted cashew.  Nice beginning, although the heat and flavors were really watered down in comparison to this salad served in Thailand. Grilled Pork Jowel - more salad-y than the name leads on.  Basically tiny pieces of pork on sliced watermelon cubes, with crunchy chicharron on it.  Tasty, but not what I expected. Khao Soi - Decent dish, but again watered down spices and flavors compared to the original served in Chiang Mai.  I also thought the chicken meat was a little chewy and sinewy compared to the chicken used in the Mango Salad. Sizzling Sisig - Really disappointed by this dish.  It was pushed on us as the best dish by the waiter, and we are pretty adventurous, so its not that its pig head that made us not love this.  It's just fatty pieces of meat crisping on a hot plate with an egg that you fry.  Not really revolutionary and did not think you need to charge an extra $3 for rice that must ""accompany the dish.""  Meh. Banana Roll Dessert - Good, its banana fried in dough.  What's bad about that. As for service, pretty good.  Few flubs and overzealous busboys.  Like one reset the place settings and then took out the settings again next to us during our meal, although no one sat there the entire night.  A little over generous with their beer pour, we finally had to place the shared Tiger away from them.  Waiter asked us how our Khao Soi was and we had not gotten the dish. Thus, all in all, I think they still need to work on some things and the dishes have been dulled down in flavor to match the LES masses, but not sure its worth all they hype when it comes down to it."
13949	71	3.0	1	2012-10-03	"Went in on a wednesday evening after noticing it was pretty quiet, no sign of the wait that was mentioned in previous reviews. We went against the waitresses reccomendation that we order 2 or 3 small plates and one large plate for 2 people and went with 1 and 1.We had the supposedly spicy chickpeas which wernt very spicy, the sizzling sisig and the the crispy pata. For a place thats called pig and rice in thai, you would presume the not so large ""large plates"" for $26 would come with a side of rice but no, thatll cost you $3. The dishes themselves tasted pretty good and a big plus goes to the sour liver dipping sauce( as disgusting as that sounds) that comes with the crispy pata. One thing im not very fond of is the literal 3 inch space between every table. I like my personal space and really prefer not hearing about the 2 guys next to me talking about there failed endeavors in the online dating world and there exchange on sites which were offering free 6 month promotions. I do wish the one gentleman luck on his date next friday though."
13950	71	5.0	1	2012-10-02	Everything was quite good, but there's a pig in the restaurant's name.... go with the pork. The family secret sauce on the pata gave me pork flashbacks the whole next day. Reasonably priced and delicious. I'll definitely be back.
13951	71	5.0	1	2012-10-01	Went with a few friends and was able to do a tasting of about half the menu.  This place is very good and gives each dish the necessary attention required to get five stars. Ambience- great, everything is nice and new, we sat outside in the backyard.  Its spacious and youre not on top of each other. Food- delicious, and i got to taste many dishes.  I suggest ordering a side of coconut rice and jasmine rice and then mix it in with the main courses, like the Sisig.  I also had the quail and the chinese sausage salad (spicy!) and all were delicious.  But the lamb ribs stole the show- you basically make your own lamb tacos with yogurt and pickled beets.  Best dish of the night. Dessert- tried the banana and then the shaved ice, both recommended. Service- our server was friendly and very helpful.  They didnt rush us, in fact, they let us sit all night eating and drinking.   The chef even came out and said hello to us.  Well done P&K!!!
13952	71	5.0	1	2012-10-01	"Rather than talk about wait times and other bullshit that really doesn't matter, I'll get right down to business. Can't Miss Dishes: Sizzling Sisig - so let me get this straight, you break down a pig's face, cook/braise/season it 8,000 different ways until it culminates with little morsels of crispy, succulent pig bits that gets an egg cracked on top of it, served on a hot cast iron plate? Yes please. Crispy Pata - JFC. Just order this, it's retarded. Jump ball between the Pata and the Sisig for best dish at P&K. Khao Soi - really dug this bowl of noodles. The cripsy noodles they add into the regular noodles give it a nice balance of textures and does a great job of soaking up the delicious curry broth. Didn't love the chicken in here, but only bc I'm a chicken hater. Overall, this is quite decadent. Curry Lamb Ribs - fake-me-out lettuce wraps, with whole wheat roti subbing in for the lettuce. Lamb was very good, and really liked the pickled beets that came with this. The chickpeas we had were kinda meh, I wouldn't order them again. And the Grilled Pork Jowl reminded me too much of that watermelon salad with pork thing they serve at Fatty Crab. I know the Fatty Crew is involved here but, you know, we've already seen that trick. Note: they don't have a liquor license yet so the ""cocktail list"" is beer and wine based. Which isn't a bad thing, just want to give you guys a head's up. BUT, if you're like me and you enjoy Micheladas then the one here will definitely hit the spot (PROTIP: ask for an extra shot of the tomato juice on the side, so you can re-up as you add more cerveza)."
13953	71	2.0	1	2012-10-01	For the record, I was really looking forward to checking out the newest Filipino restaurant in town.  I knew it was going to be wildly crowded because it had only been open for about a week and a half, so I was completely prepared for our party of 8 to wait around an hour for a table.  What I was not expecting was having to wait almost 3 hours, after being told several times that our table would be ready in 'just ten more minutes'. The manger came over and apologized several times, telling us that we'd be seated in 10 minutes and that he'd bring over some snacks for us to munch on in the mean time.  We were told that they'd be bringing over snacks a total of 3 times, but they never came.  We were told our table would be ready in short order, but they really meant over 2 and a half hours.  We looked over the menu in the waiting area and ordered before we'd even sat down.  By this point, it was a little after 10 PM. Again, I went into this situation knowing that our party of 8 would have a substantial wait before we were seated.  It is, however, completely unacceptable for the manager of a restaurant to blatantly mislead customers into thinking that they'll be seated shortly, when the reality is much, much different.  If he had just been honest and told us that we'd have to wait at least two hours, we could have gone to the bar across the street and come back later.   We ordered a variety of dishes that were all tasty, but definitely overpriced.  The complexity of the flavors being used and the portion sizes were not equivalent to the $13 price tag.  And honestly, charging $26 for a medium sized portion of  crispy pata is just ridiculous.  We also ordered the crispy rice and curry dish, which was tasty, but I couldn't help but think that I was paying around $13 for a small pile of rice and minuscule pieces of meat.   Was the food good?  Yes, it was pretty much decent.  Would I be inclined to go back, be treated poorly by a manager who has no idea how to manage a restaurant, and then pay too much money for small portions of only average food?  Absolutely not.
9728	71	3.0	1	2012-09-30	"3.5 stars. Top Chef Leah Cohen partners up with the Fatty Crew... and opens up this hipster, very appropriate LES restaurant that flairs Asian Fusion, predominantly Thai with Filipino influences.  It's a great spot if you want to kick back and have a few fun cocktails and try some interesting, spicy & sizzling dishes.  Khao literally means ""rice"" in Thai, but the naming convention has a fun play on animals.   The restaurant itself is probably 90% meat.  BE prepared.  We shared the quail adobo, sisig & noodles with red curry & chicken.   All pretty good choices... the sisig had some heat to it...that made it unbearable for my friend... i loved it....  the noodles were VERY good... something I can see myself eating again.  had a bit of sweet, spicy, crunchy... lots of textures, and the chicken was super tender, as were the noodles, which were so delicate.   my least favorite was probably the quail.  it was crispy, but a tad bit on the bland side.  i've had better...but since I love quail, i generally never say no and am usually able to finish it. i pointed to what looked like a coconut cocktail conconction in its own shell.....  i found out AFTER the fact that I have already ordered...that the coconut juice was mixed with sherry & whiskey barrel bitters.... not bad.  could have been stronger, but it was still really fun to drink out of. pig & khao's got great potential.  especially in the little hip side of the neighborhood they call Lower East Side.  There are so many more items on the menu that is a must try for next time."
13954	71	1.0	1	2012-09-28	the staff made me feel stupid and unhip enough for their restaurant. waiter said he just moved to town, i grew up around the corner!
12726	71	4.0	1	2012-09-27	I went tonight after hearing about the buzz, and I'm always searching for good Filipino food that rivals homecooking. This space is cute- very different from the old Felai decor, and I especially appreciated the Filipino stars that adorned the backyard. As far as the food goes, it's good for Filipino fusion- much better than other places that I've been to in the city. I had the sisig which was spicy, but lacked the characteristic crispiness. The pata was good, but it wasn't really pata (pork hooves). It was really lechon, roasted pig. The end to my meal was satisfying- the halo halo had all the ingredients that I love- pinipig, flan, and ube ice cream with shaved ice.
13955	71	4.0	1	2012-09-27	I've only been here a few times but everytime I come here I love it!! Its so delicious...I never though I'd like pork that much.  I just feel sad for the little piggies that had to sacrifice their lives for my delicious meal. Plus the all you can drink beer is really cool.
13956	71	5.0	1	2012-09-26	My friends and decided to check this out after we read that it's a restaurant that just focuses on PORK. What's not to love?! Also, if you go on a good day, you can sit out in the patio, which looked very nice when I peeked outside. They have $15 all you can drink beer and you go tap that yourself. Kind of cool but we passed on that to save room for all the pigs we ate :D We were a group of five and got one large plate and 3 small plates. It's more of a sharing restaurant, so don't be germaphobic. Crispy Pata is MUST. I don't care what you think about pork. If you're coming to this restaurant, you need to eat this. The skin was so crispy and the meat was super tender and moist, not dry at all. And it came with this AMAZING LIVER SAUCE. Who knew liver sauce could be that awesome?! For the small dishes, we got the quail adobo, which was really good and had really yummy sauce but only one tiny quail egg. It was awkward to split that egg, but no fear, my spoon-splitting skills are amazing. We also got the Grilled Pork Jowl, which was the most interesting. It was on the spicy side, but nothing too extreme. The pork was basically fried, crispy pork fat. Again, what's not to like? The watermelon went surprisingly well with it too! The last small dish we had was the Khao Soi, which is a curry noodle dish. It was good, but not as good as the rest of the dishes. The pork was really tender, but the curry was more coconut milky than I would've preferred. It gets spicier as you eat it though. We got some white rice to finish out the curry after we ate all the noodles.  I would recommend trying another noodle dish if that's what you're here for. All in all, a good, piggy experience! My friend and I also got the Phuket Punch, which was good, if you want a cocktail. In my opinion, it's a little pricier than two dollar signs, but not something terrible. The four dishes, two cocktails and one beer came out to be a little over 100.

We were a table of seven which enabled us to sample most of the menu.  The combination of flavors and the way they popped out was amazing.  The deserts were killer,OMG. Our waitress was great and very knowledgeable.  She was able to describe each dish and knew all the ingredients.  The service was attentive and we were not  at all rushed.   The decor was new, clean , crisp and stylish.  I loved the dragon scooter. The outside patio area was an added plus and very comfortable. I can't wait to go back.
13958	72	5.0	1	2015-01-05	This is the best Chinese food restaurant in town and around I love the place is really clean and the food is amazing also their delivery is really really fast!! I love this place!
13959	72	5.0	1	2014-11-21	I recently moved to Bergen county and realized I've been spoiled.  Panda has offered great food at a fair price for so long I just assumed it was the norm.  Best pork fried rice around, and something as easy as fried chicken is somehow made better here.  I miss this place and will order from it whenever I come back to town.  Don't even get me started on Bergen county pizza.
13960	72	3.0	1	2014-09-07	The name caught my attention, so I decides to try it. The food was good and cheap. Will visit this place again if I'm in the neighborhood.
13961	72	4.0	1	2014-07-31	The best Chinese restaurants in Belleville. The food isn't too greasy. General Tso's chicken is not too spicy, seasoned just right. Service is quick, especially when picking up.
13962	72	4.0	1	2013-10-17	This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area.  I've been going here for over a decade and their food is very consistent.  My family orders from here once a week.  I always order the same thing and don't venture out of it.  The general tsos chicken (white meat) and a small steamed vegetables.  Try this place out, you won't be disappointed.  It looks like the typical Chinese restaurants from the appearance but the food is really good.  I did not give them 5 stars because I have been going their for over ten years and whenever I walk in they have no idea who i am.  There is one guy who takes orders by the phone who is not the nicest person; but maybe that's just how he is normally.  The female person there is nice and so are the twin guys.  Also, if you ask for any sauce packets, make sure their in the bag before you leave.
13963	72	5.0	1	2013-10-17	This my favorite Chinese place! Their beef and broccoli and chicken and broccoli are fantastic. The plantains are absolutely delicious. This is my go to place for Chinese deliciousness.
13964	72	4.0	1	2013-03-06	Good neighborhood Chinese takeout. Delivery is quick and food always hot. In an area where there are Chinese Restuarnts on every corner, this is my go-to place.
13965	73	1.0	-1	2014-07-08	Recently sat on the patio on a beautiful afternoon for a late lunch.  Unfortunately, the service was poor.   We ordered our lunches and waited patiently with no water for 25 minutes.  A manager came over and asked how everything was.  Really?  We are sitting at an empty table with empty water glasses.  He brought out water and our waitress who asked if wanted bread.  2 minutes later she came out with our order but no bread.  She seemed surprised when we asked for that again.  The chicken and brie panini I ordered had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp - it was dry and crumbly.  Not very much chicken and no pizzazz.  The waitress never came over to check on us, or to refill our water.  We just sat there with a table full of dirty dishes.  Finally, after waiting for quite some time, we had to ask the hostess for our check.  A busboy brought us the check and the waitress came back for payment.  Interestingly, there was a manager on the patio most of the time but he didn't seem to be interested in attending to his guests.  There are so many great places on Palmer Square, don't pick this one.
13966	73	1.0	-1	2012-07-27	"If you can ""get"" served a drink, it might actually taste good, but the waitstaff is so disrespectful and pretentious, it just kills the enjoyment. I thought the first time here was bad. It gets worse. The waitstaff (one huge chick who thinks she's God's gift) ignores you. Not just you, everyone at the bar except the servers. They serve the servers first then the customers at the bar get served. You could wait 10 min to get anyone's attention. The problem: nasty waitstaff who won't give an ounce of attention to people who are supposedly going to give them a good tip. NOT! The food: average. They don't even have a fish fry on Friday. Not worth the wait. Go someplace else. I know I will."
13967	73	2.0	-1	2012-12-29	This is unequivocally the worst place I have ever been to with respect to service. It has great character and all the potential in the world to be an excellent Princeton bar/eatery but is clearly mismanaged. I live in Princeton and eat out often but refuse to stop at the Tap Room because of the lack of attentive service from both the bar staff and restaurant/dining staff. I've sat outside on their amazing patio in the spring and couldn't get a drink to save my life. Sat at the bar on multiple occasions with an empty glass and sat in the restaurant with an empty water glass for the duration of the meal. I have yet to have a positive experience at the Tap Room but I give it two stars because of the character, the potential it has, and of course the Norman Rockwell behind the bar.
13968	73	2.0	-1	2009-11-13	"While I haven't had the pleasure of dining at the Tap Room yet, I have had the displeasure (on several occasions) of terrible bar service. On one hand, I did receive my beer in a clean glass, and it was nice and cold, but that's to be expected. But the staff are less than pleasant or polite. When I asked how the bartender was doing, a friendly ""hi, how are you?"", (before I ordered) she gave me a long (unanswered) blank stare, and grumbled ""What do you want?"" She had the angriest look on her face, was slamming things down on the bar to convey her anger to whatever customer must have aggravated her that night, rolled her eyes at patrons, and pulled me a nice Newcastle Brown Ale. Moving on, there was no where to sit, however the kitchen was closed, so we asked another employee politely if the dining area would be open for seating. She snapped ""The kitchen is CLOSED"" and we quitely interjected that we understood this much, but that we would like to sit and drink at a table, if possible. She complained as she cleared the forks and napkins from that table (set up for breakfast for the following day.) As she walked away she muttered more complaints under her breath, sneering at other customers who'd done the same as we had. I understand, people have some bad nights at work. But on every single occasion I have been to the tap room, the staff were the same. Never delightful. And what a shame it is that they're so grumpy, because otherwise the bar has a beautiful cozy atmosphere, historic feel, and a decent amount of space. They could have told my friend and I that the tables were not available for bar seating to avoid the task of clearing the table for us. We would have gladly accepted that, and stood. And afterall, we were thankful it was cleared for us to sit, but the server's attitude was apalling. As for the bartender, her personality may not be the happiest, but she's always there with a sour-puss on her face, no matter what. If you can put up with rude and unpleasant staff, then this bar may be worth checking out, once. But probably just once, as I made the mistake of giving it the benefit of the doubt a few more times than necessary."
13969	73	3.0	-1	2013-09-15	I went here for a sunday lunch. I haven't been  here in many many years. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was so yummy. I will  back to try other things.
13970	73	4.0	-1	2014-08-12	Really neat pub! Lots of history! Accommodating staff! Great patio! Love bringing the family for dinner! Lauren has been our server a couple time and was professional and attentive!   One suggestion: keep up with the wine list! Last time you were out of some! :)
13971	73	4.0	-1	2012-09-02	We came here on a Friday evening and wanted to sit outside, and we had to wait for 30 minutes. No complaints about the staff, we found them to be very friendly. The terrace outside is also a nice location to have dinner. We had the suggested beers, which were both really nice, the suggested burger, and the standard burger on the menu. Both were nice and what we expected of a burger at a place like this. This place (especially the terrace, since we didn't go inside) really seemed like a nice place to have some beers with friends on a nice summer evening, and maybe order some sliders or other snacks. Would come here again!
13972	73	4.0	-1	2012-05-07	My husband and I went to the Tap Room friday night for dinner. We sat outside on the patio, which we love during the summertime. Although it was very humid out,we had a great dinner.Our server was very friendly and knew all about the different drinks the bar had to offer (including the White Peach Sangria he suggested and I loved!) My husband got a couple of the different beers from their tap menu. When it came to dinner,we started with the Shrimp Flatbread. It put a fresh twist on a classic dish. For dinner, I had the chopped salad and my husband had the fish taco. The salad was delicious, although next time i would put the dressing on the side. The fish taco was suprisingly from an American restaurant. After all of that we decided to skip dessert. We have lived in town for years and it seems that the Tap Room has really made some great improvements over time!!
13973	73	4.0	-1	2011-12-29	Had a very nice, pleasant dining experience. My date ordered glazed chicken with rice and asparagus, which he enjoyed, and I very much enjoyed my pasta penne with vodka sauce, peas and mushrooms. We ordered dinner early - about 5 p.m. The spikey-haired waitress was lovely, friendly, accommodating and wished us a Happy New Year. We were given good service, but not rushed along and asked if we needed any alternatives to what we were given as well. A very well-rounded dining experience. I would return.
13974	73	4.0	-1	2010-07-21	Took the family to Princeton to see what was new and interesting. We came upon the new patio dining area outside the Yankee Doodle Tap Room at the Nassau Inn and gave it a try. Lots of umbrellas and misting fans to keep things cool with comfortable seating. Service was enthuasiatic and attentive. It looked like a special menu for the outside and we ate a bit light going for appetizers and the excellent salads. Great humus presentation with nice flatbreads - good wings - very substantial and creative salads featuring interesting use of fruits and cheeses. We will definitely return - it will be a great people watching spot when the students return and the pace in town picks up. A great addition to a town that really lends itself to outside dining.
13975	73	5.0	-1	2014-08-12	I visited the Yankee doodle tap room today for lunch with my mother.. it was an experience she will not forget. the waitress was awesome to her and so was the staff. the food knocked her shoes off. we started out with the cheese plate and ended up with the pecan pie tart for dessert I would like to personally thank the food and beverage director Mr. Jim Byrnes for personally coming to our table and chatting it up with mom..it made her feel special. the other servers, bartender john Ryan fry, Julie Heise, Gary the oldtimer and Anastasia HR director for making this a day my Mom will not forget.. PS the Princetonian burger is the best burger I have ever eaten.Thanks to Alex the chef and  Manual for the quiche.. A place to remember. Thanks All!!
13976	73	5.0	-1	2012-10-03	We stayed at the Nassau Inn over the weekend and had cocktails, dinner and breakfast at the Tap Room. It is always such a warm and welcoming place. The staff is superb, professional and friendly. The salmon was delicious, as well as the steak, and breakfast was yummy!   Our room was lovely, with the newly-renovated beautiful bathroom, and very quiet. The bed was especially comfortable. We always enjoy visiting Princeton for the arts and atmosphere, and find the Nassau Inn is a big part of that. We urge everyone to go there and decide for themselves rather than reading negative comments.
13977	73	5.0	-1	2012-10-02	I don't know if maybe they've gotten a new chef or hired new servers or something, because a lot of the reviews I've read are negative, but I can't think of anything bad to say about my experience. I stayed at the hotel for a weekend back in September and I loved everything about it, particularly the service at the Tap Room. I ate at the restaurant three times, twice for lunch and once for dinner. I had a delicious Summer Salad and absolutely LOVED the truffle fries (incredible). Had a few other things but can't remember what, these two definitely stood out. Nice place to go grab a drink in the early evening, and the staff was very friendly. Will definitely return again in the future.
13978	73	5.0	-1	2012-05-22	A group of girlfriends and I came in saturday night for dinner and drinks. The outside patio was full and on a 45 minute wait. We went inside to the bar and waited outside at a high top table till our tAble was ready (about 30 minutes later). Once we sat, we got a shrimp flatbread and crab & melon for apps... they both were delicious!!! for dinner, all of us had salads.Everyone of the salads was good, although the chicken on mine was not very warm. Overall, we were very happy with the service and the meal, and of course the cocktails! Our server was very friendly and saw how pleased we were. In the checkbook, the restaurant hands out not only comment cards but business card sized papers encouraging guests to go on tripadvisor and yelp. I thought that was a great way to advertise what they are doing in social media and decided to sign up!! Thanks for another good ladies night!
13979	73	5.0	-1	2008-07-31	the nice quiet atmosphere of a historic pub with some of the most knoledgable bartenders that you will ever meet.  The whole staff of the Nassau Inn goes out of their way to make you feel confortable. The  meals appear to be slightly pricy at first glance of the menu but once you taste the food you leave feeling that you should have payed alot more. Their menu also has something for everyone and they have the best sweetpotato fries you will ever have in your life..i wouldnt call it a sports bar but it definately is a great place to kick back with a beer and watch a  game. it is also the only bar in town that is gaurenteed to be open on all holidays including christmas !!! if you havent been i suggest you go I will definately be returning !
9272	73	4.0	1	2014-12-25	All the old photos of Princeton alumni are pretty cool. Saw FLOTUS, a few Supreme Court Justices, and more. Very neat. Beer selection isn't bad.
13980	73	2.0	1	2014-12-24	"They are going down hill. Walked in last night and the host ignored us at first. Then he said ""be right with you"" while shuffling some papers. The food ranged from horrible (mussels) to mediocre (anemic looking fries) to decent (burgers.)  Very slow service. It was weirdly quiet. They need music."
13981	73	1.0	1	2014-12-21	This place was once a favorite.   Regrettably, product AND service have fallen markedly.   Order a beer?  The glass was handed to me 3/4th full!   No kidding.  This happened CONSISTENTLY through the night. Order an App'y?  Wait 40 minutes and get it served cold.   We laughed incredulously as we watched the food sitting on a tray waiting for the waitstaff to deliver it. EVEN THE GLASSWARE was inconsistent.  One time, a beer was served in a beer glass.  Another time -- same beer -- was served in a ball jar.  No kidding! Our party of 8 were so disgusted, we did finally leave much earlier than planned. ..We received biker-bar service and product in an upper-scale Princeton icon.   Senior management:  It's time to review your staffing at the Yankee Doodle Tap Room.   I suggest a top-down replacement.   Your front-end (bar/waitstaff) team is going to kill your business. -KEA December 20, 2014.
13982	73	1.0	1	2014-12-07	I ate a small appetizer, fried calamari at the Nassau Inn Yankee Doodle tap room the Friday after thanksgiving. 24 hours later, I was sick with severe food poisoning-like symptoms. 24 hours after that, this article comes out. planetprinceton.com/2014… Called manager of hotel to get my one nights stay refunded to me because it's clear to me when 40 people get sick, who all have one place in common - there's something very wrong there. Manager denied my claims. The problem is, I run my own business and was unable to work with my clients for two days because of the illness caused by frequenting the Nassau Inn on that Friday.  So, I believe a refund is more than fair and am appalled at the management of the Inn and its restaurant. I hope the health department shuts them down - I can't believe there have been no reported consequences yet as a result of this incredible story. I will never stay here again. I'd rather stay further out of town and avoid this nonsense. Or maybe I'll go to The Peacock Inn - who has it figured out.

13984	73	4.0	1	2014-11-15	The BEST cheeseburger you will ever eat in your life. Don't even think about ordering anything else. And try to get a booth so you can carve your name along with all the other legendary people who have eaten there. The Yankee Doodle Tap Room is the epitome of the Ivy League and has a long, storied history. Take a peak upstairs at the common room of the historic Nassau Inn.
13985	73	1.0	1	2014-11-08	Had an awful food experience today.. Started out promising.. The waitress was ok, but the menu was very decent and we were excited to get our food.  Well I would have rather stayed home I guess.  Everything expect for my French onion soup was so very Mediocre.  Hummus was the worst excuse for hummus I've had.  Tuna tacos overlooked (supposed to be seared not well done) and was very skimpy. My poor husband and his veggie burger.  My two year old did eat her hot dog without any complaint. Not worth the money and don't get excited for your food to come out
13986	73	3.0	1	2014-11-01	Ok - so - I liked the vibe of this place, the wooden booths, the very friendly staff and the location. We also had a coupon mind you (and the restaurant very graciously entertained the coupon the next day when I realized it had not been used) BUT I would not order what I ordered again. I would go there again for a burger and a beer. I should have went with my first choice (beer and quinoa burger) BUT wasn't that hungry and decided on 2 appetizers and a glass of malbec. My boyfriend ordered the Princetonian burger which was good. When the hummus arrived I was happy at the size of the portion. It was very good and so was the pita. The kalamatta olives however tasted old or stale. So did the malbec.  I also was not positive it was even malbec. The mussels with chorizo in an apple cider sauce were just ok. I obviously didn't dislike it because I ate it all. My review would probably be different/better if I went back and tried something else....
13987	73	1.0	1	2014-09-19	"The service may be lousy, but at least the food is only average and the drinks are overpriced. The Yankee Doodle Tap Room -- or ""The Nass"" as it's known among the student body and alumni -- reeks with tradition and nostalgia, and that may merit a visit.  That said, the quality of service and food hearkens back to a time when The Nass was the only game in town, and there are myriad better places to eat and drink that have cropped up in the past 30 years that are vastly superior and more friendly. Favorite two stories -- one night a group of us placed an order.  We were continually assured by our server that ""the food will be right out.""  An hour later, same server confesses that the kitchen printer broke, and our order never made it to the cooks.  One might expect a visit by the manager with an apology and an offer for a drink or a dessert on the house, right? Not here. More recently, my friend and I ordered two of the same brand of single malt scotch, one neat, the other ""with a little bit of ice"" (his words).   Neat scotch:  $12  Scotch with two ice cubes:  $14.  I asked the server, who shrugged her shoulders and said ""that just the way it is here."" Worth a visit.  Once."
13988	73	2.0	1	2014-09-13	Went for drinks and I enjoyed my peach sangria.  My companions enjoyed their cocktails as well. Great outdoor patio space, however none of the tables were cleared outside (dishes were left on them), so we had to clear our own to sit down. The bartender was fine, but not especially helpful.  As other reviewers have mentioned, go for the patio but the service is a major drawback.
13989	73	2.0	1	2014-08-31	Mediocre, if you like that sort if thing. Don't expect to be blown off your feet here. Just a more expensive Applebee's. Good place to bring kids for a quick easy meal.
10966	73	2.0	1	2014-08-30	"It seems like you couldn't go wrong with a beautiful outdoor patio in the heart of Palmer Square, but you'd be mistaken. Food is mediocre and overpriced and the service is consistently awful. Food and drink orders take forever, and the ""rules"" about whether you can walk inside to get your own drink at the bar and sit outside for happy hour change frequently. Management seems aware of the problem but has yet to address it seriously."
13990	73	1.0	1	2014-08-23	"My restauranteur friend says negative yelp reviews suck, since no one tells them in person. She said leave 10% and talk to the manager. So I did, but the manager's response was worse than the service that I received, so I have to write this. To sum: Sat outside, 15 minutes to order, beer order was messed up, after I got my food she never came back , water ran dry. After a long time, I had to give my credit card to the host, since my waitress was MIA. All SHE came back with was the charge slip, no bill, so I have NO idea what I paid for. I talked to the manager. Her response:   ""I'm sorry, I hope that doesn't deter you from coming back.""  Awkward silence. Um, it  does deter me, that's why I'm coming to you. I'm not sure what I was expecting but something different. ""Oh she messed up your beer order? Your next one is on is.""  Something. A pulse. An eye twitch...."
13991	73	2.0	1	2014-08-21	Came here for lunch with my husband on a weekend. We ordered beers and appitizers. The food and beer were both very good. The service was terrible. I would have given this a 2.5 because what we got was good but the delivery was not. They didnt have a beer list available which was fine but then the server should be educated in what they have. We overheard another waitress making negative comments about customers who only order appitizers which was really offputting to us. After our waitress dropped off the food and drinks she never came back. Didnt ask if we wanted a refill (which we did but ended up going somewhere else), didnt ask if the food was okay or if we needed anything else. We waited so long after we were done with everything to see her again that we just took the check and left. I would go back but would stick to sitting at the bar.
13992	73	2.0	1	2014-08-11	"Almost every time we visit Princeton, we stumble into this place.  Almost by accident, it seems. I'd give it 2.5 stars total, but yelp won't allow. I rated it two stars, however, because of the ""meh"" food. On my first trip, I met a friend from the area who recommended it.  The history/decor/atmosphere of the restaurant is unique and worth a single visit.  Beer selection is solid, though not overwhelming.  And on a nice summer afternoon, the patio offers plenty of outdoor seating (a welcome respite). Service outside was painfully slow, however.  My water glass was empty for the majority of lunch (refilled once after I flagged down the waitress), bill was slow to arrive (and she gave me the wrong one).  Seemed she had tables inside and out, which probably slowed things down a bit. Inside, it's a combination of history and college bar feel (replete with lots of initials carved into every single wood surface).  So, 3.5 stars for the atmosphere.   The steak frites I had last time underwhelmed.  Overdone (requested medium...much closer to medium well/well).  The marinade wasn't very good, either.  Disappointing.  The reuben (from a previous visit) was slightly better, but in no way memorable.  Truffle fries were good, but not that different in taste than the regular fries (unless the fries served with the kids menu are also of the truffle variety.  Perhaps?  As it's tough for me to justify $6.95 for a grilled cheese and regular fries for a 2.5 year old). Overall, it's a passable place.  And one that, if stuck in Palmer Square, I'd probably head back for a drink.  But next time, I think we'll try another place in the vicinity."
13993	73	3.0	1	2014-07-29	I'm still giving this place a three for ambiance and drinks in the winter. However, now that I've had a meal here, I would rate the food a two. While I really like the outdoor patio, the food was extremely underwhelming and definitely not worth the price.
13994	73	4.0	1	2014-07-25	"Had a great dinner experience here with friends - we were celebrating a 21st birthday, and our server was very friendly and attentive. Sit outdoors if you get the chance! The food is delicious - we ordered mostly ""small"" plates, except for two friends who shared a burger, and the ""small"" plates are definitely not small. The burrata crostini is absolutely delicious. We also had a few beers and the really excellent pear cider. The atmosphere is very relaxed and overall it's an amazing establishment in the heart of Princeton."
13995	73	4.0	1	2014-07-23	I came here for lunch with my sister. We only ate, we didn't have anything to drink from the bar. I really enjoy the atmosphere here, its cozy and warm even on the coldest of days. You can feel the history in the air of this place, its very cool! I also love the names engraved into the table tops. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. I have to say that we really enjoyed the food! We had the Flatbread with Honey & Prosciutto app which was AWESOME. We also had the cheese plate and the chicken pot pie. I can't speak for the bar or late night dinning, which I know is popular at this spot. Lunch was wonderful and tasty. I look forward to come back to the Tap Room for another good meal.
10702	73	2.0	1	2014-07-07	"This place is a Princeton establishment - so much history nestled into a snug little restaurant/bar/outdoor area within a very beautiful inn. As others have mentioned, it's worth a visit to just see the signed pictures on the walls and the beautiful Norman Rockwell mural. However, each time I have been here over the past year the service has been unacceptable. Recently sat outside for 20 minutes after being seated by the hostess before having to go flag someone down to even be greeted. The server from then on treated us pretty coldly because I had inquired as to when anyone would be helping us (it was not very busy and after lunch hours). Another time I was seated inside on a rather slow weekday evening and had similarly awful service. We placed an order for food and nearly an hour later still nothing. When we asked the waitress what was going on she coldly replied that they were ""very busy"" (there were probably fewer than a dozen people in the whole place and appeared to be well staffed). As for the food, it's good, though honestly not the best in Princeton. Each time I have been here I've considered not coming back due to the service as it has really dampened the mood."
13996	73	1.0	1	2014-07-07	We went this past Saturday. We sat outside. The waitress came over about ten minutes with three glasses of water, there was four of us. She then came back with another. She came back about 10-15 minutes later and asked for the order. Then we sat and waited and waited and waited. We were all done with our water and she never came back for refills. The manager came over and asked how we were and we said fine except we have no drinks or water. He came over and refilled us then the waitress came back and asked if we wanted bread in the meantime. didn't bring it. Our food came then came. I had to ask her for the bread. After that never saw her again. finally after about twenty minutes, we saw her and asked for the check. and guess what! she never came back. I walked up to the hostess and told her to get someone to bring our check. It wasn't even the waitress that brought it out. The manager was outside the whole time and knew we were mad and didn't even address the situation. There was no one inside and a handful of people outside with three of four other waitresses. she wasn't even helping someone else. It was obviously a problem
10986	73	2.0	1	2014-06-04	Meh is all I can say.  Went for lunch when there was  only 1 other group of 4 and me (table of 1) sitting out on the patio.  I ordered the summer steak salad and it was just ok.  Don't get be wrong, the steak was delicious, but everything else from the salad was bland, bland , bland.  The corn tasted like it was out of a can and the dressing the lacked the peppercorn taste the menu promised.  Service was a on the unattentive side, as I sat for 10 minutes with an empty glass of water when that was all I was drinking.  Plus it took almost half an hour to get just a salad. Not sure if I will try this again.
13997	73	2.0	1	2014-05-28	"Came here after a wedding for the ""after party"". The bar was on the quieter side until we showed up. The bartenders were nice enough to give us trail mix (but we had to ask). However, they weren't the friendliest...They kicked us out after last call, and we asked for some plastic cups. We could clearly see that they had a stash, but they refused to give us some. I pointed out the plastic cups and they gave me like 5 or so. Meh! I'd say, if you're staying at the Inn, it's a low key spot to grab a drink, but if it weren't for the wedding party congregating there, I probably would have opted to go to try a different bar in the area."
13998	73	4.0	1	2014-05-23	Pretty cool spot...  I loved the atmosphere but did not like the small size of the beers.  The prices were reasonable and the service was fine.  Some younger folks were a bit loud for such a small spot.  The food we had was great but nothing available after 10pm.
13999	73	3.0	1	2014-05-13	Breakfasts are not amazing but food is good. No options are very creative. Service is quick. A bit pricey for what it is, but this is expected for a hotel. Cozy atmosphere. Better ambiance than PJs pancake house
14000	73	2.0	1	2014-04-27	A group of friends arranged a brunch here this past weekend, and when we walked in we were interested in the unique environment - it was dark, but still cozy and provided good atmosphere for catching up. Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away with the menu. I got the breakfast pita and my husband got the country benedict. The pita dish was kind of cold by the time I received it to eat, and the potatoes on both of our dishes needed more seasoning. We sampled a friend's pancakes, which were more tasty. In general, the service was okay, and the food was not bad, but it was not very memorable and we probably would not come back here for breakfast.
14001	73	5.0	1	2014-04-14	Have really enjoyed this restaurant. Great atmosphere. Food exceeded my expectations. Strawberry shortcake was awesome!
14002	73	1.0	1	2014-01-10	Amazing ambiance and history with so much potential. However, this bar and restaurant continue to disappoint in food and terribly poor service. It's great for one drink, but that's about it.
10701	73	3.0	1	2014-01-09	This place gets it's name from the Norman Rockwell mural over the bar. It's nice to sit by the fire place in winter and sip a beer. Service at the bar is really slow. We've come here mostly to get a beer or two but it takes forever sometimes. There's a gallery of famous Princeton alumni including Brooke Shields.
14003	73	5.0	1	2013-12-27	I like this place. Why? The staff are great and friendly, the food isnt the quickest, but its not slow and really worth waiting for. Hangar steak for lunch mmm. Its got a great beer garden. Best one in Princeton.  We've been in a couple of times with our stroller and the staff havehave always seated us in a good place. Its our fav bar in Princeton
14004	73	2.0	1	2013-12-21	"It's a pub, what do you expect? Better than some alternatives in town, like the Ivy Inn, but the service is pretty slow and not that great. Even if you're sitting right at the bar, sometimes it can take forever for the bar tenders to acknowledge that you're there. Maybe the bar tenders are so independently wealthy that they don't need your money? Don't go on a ""game night,"" as the place will be packed with lots of douchey people."
14005	73	4.0	1	2013-12-07	I am a fan of the burgers and the drinks. I think you have to choose carefully to get a good value on the cocktails, but I appreciate the variety and the changes in offerings with the seasons. The taps are also pretty varied and include some local brews, which I appreciate. Came here for an early dinner with colleagues and service was prompt and attentive. My burger was great -- perfectly cooked, moist and flavorful. If only the fries were more inspiring, this would become a more regular addition to my go-to meal venues in town.
14006	73	4.0	1	2013-10-16	"I am a fan of Yankee Doodle Tap Room burgers! This tap room is an extension of Nassau Inn in Princeton. Although it is supposedly known for the drinks before football games, my date an I decided to eat the burgers instead. The Princetonian (for a mere $14) is the face of the burgers in this Princeton tap room. This burger is made of a special kind of meat that I would describe as ""rib-like"" not really sure what it is but it is DELICIOUS. My favorite though is the Jersey Burger ($15) made with an egg on top, I would give the burgers a 4/5 which is why I give the restaurant a 4/5. The burgers are much larger than typical $14-$15 burgers, which is also definitely a plus. Plus, the staff was VERY nice and courteous, and also gave us the quiet and space we wanted throughout the meal."
14007	73	3.0	1	2013-09-08	Service was really bad , we waited about 20 mins for our order, then we didnt see the server for another 20 mins, We order drinks and that was about another 20 mins. The food was really good and the outside atmosphere is great too. But service was less then acceptable
14008	73	2.0	1	2013-05-20	This review refers specifically to the outdoor garden terrace for dinner. My review for the interior would be completely different. Perhaps it would be different for breakfast. Sorry, but I have to give a failing grade to the exterior terrace section where it's completely obvious the restaurant is gliding arrogantly on its history in the evening hours. And I haven't done that here in Princeton ever anywhere, and have lived here for eighteen years. Would recommend instead Agricola, Mediterra, Witherspoon Grill, Blue Point Grill, Acacia, Elements, and Tiger Noodles. Most have terraces. All these are far superior. I've been looking forward to eating at the Terrace section since it opened, but the weather doesn't usually cooperate. Usually it's too hot or too cold. Tonight, the weather was balmy and perfect. The experience should have been at least passable. And I have to say the company I was with was happy, and that the table and chair where I sat were clean... Other than that, my dinner was entirely a huge disappointment, and worthy of a complaint to the Better Business Bureau. The management should be upbraided. Horrible experience. My Top Ten complaints: 1)  My water glass was chipped and cracked, and of poor cheap quality. Hurt my mouth, and probably bloodied it. Should have been tossed. 2)  Needed a placemat at the very least on this coarse sort of aluminum garden table. 3)  Had to place our own fork and knife on aluminum ourselves even at these high prices. 4)  The pasta dish I had must have been made by an inexperienced fifteen year old. It was physically an unappealing, disorganized dish, although the vegetables were fine, but extremely greasy and dripping with oil. Unacceptable. 5)  The lighting was beyond lousy.The worst part of the meal. I couldn't see my food. Totally unacceptable. Lights built into the walls lit at seat and shoe level. I couldn't see my food on the table in the dark. I asked for a candle, but my request was shrugged off. No one had a candle, and I don't think anyone else could see what they were eating either. Very bad. 6)  We got there at 8 p.m. ~ normally a civilized hour for dinner internationally ~ Even so, the wait staff were preparing to leave, stacking up cushions, twirling down the umbrellas. Very disappointing. 7)  No bread or freebies brought to our table. 8)  Very expensive for what we got. 9)  No manager came and asked how our meal was going. So I couldn't say my problems to management in person. Management was non-existent. Service generally was uncaring. I don't think management ever eats here, sits in the dark, and eats this food. Totally unacceptable. 10)  Waiter rarely came by, and was inexperienced. Sorry to have to say all this. Truth to power. And I hope the powerful do something to change the terrace for the better. Management has to do something. It  could be so much better. Should be at those prices.
14009	73	1.0	1	2013-04-29	We had guests from out of town, a party of 6 and wanted to enjoy the nice weather on the terrace. Horrible horrible experience. Each one of the plates had something wrong, over cooked meat, missing ingredients on the plate, and it took 45min to the order out... I would never go again....
14010	73	3.0	1	2013-04-19	"Not really sure whats up with all the terrible reviews. Yes it's a bit expensive, and yes it draws an older crowd, but that shouldn't matter too much if you're looking for a place to chill and talk to friends without music blaring over your conversation. Great, greaaat beer selection and the atmosphere is pretty chill and relaxed. Definitely not a place to go ""get wasted"" but really nice to meet up with friends for a couple hours and have a nice conversation and hang out."
14011	73	3.0	1	2013-03-25	Went here on Sunday afternoon. They had a new bartender who nice, friendly, helpful, & quick. Never saw that before at this place, maybe management is waking up. That being said, I love the location and historic feel of the bar. It's great to sit with friends by the great fireplace.
14012	73	2.0	1	2013-01-10	"This is just a review of the bar scene.  Older crowd, not much happening here.  Decent selection of beers.  I asked the bartender about a specific micro brew he said it was a ""Belgian style"" ale, which I love, but when I tasted it, it was clearly very bitter and not Belgian style at all. Also, it got really hot when we were in there, to the point where it was uncomforable.  We left shortly thereafter. With so many other great options in town, this one is near the bottom of my list."
14013	73	3.0	1	2012-11-30	Depending on what night of the week you go it's gonna be difficult to get a drink from the bar.  The place gets packed on the weekends. There is a very historic atmosphere in this place with a huge fire place.
14014	73	2.0	1	2012-11-23	Had two dinners here.  One at the bar...... peppered salmon- good, good beer, good bartender.  One outside...... food was lousy, waitress wasn't very attentive.
14015	73	2.0	1	2012-10-23	We were in town for a wedding and the reception was held here. The food was great... it was the bar that left the bad taste in my mouth. I was interested in watching a college football game that was televised on a conference channel. I called a week prior to ensure that the game would be available there. When I arrived, the bar was playing three games on six tv's. When I asked if one of the smaller tv's could be changed to my game of interest, the bartender informed me that one patron - Jerry, a glassy-eyed and scruffy gent in a Princeton hat - was watching the tv. After 15 minutes I was finally able to get the exceedingly rude female bartender to check the tv guide and discover that.... they don't subscribe to the conference channel after all! Again, the food was great, and there were signed photos of Princeton grads on the wall (Michelle Obama - very cool), but the bartender was very rude, and the staff were clueless about how digital cable functions.
14016	73	1.0	1	2012-10-14	"We, party of four, arrived when the restaurant was nearly empty. We were seated promptly. Our waitress, Lauren, took our appetizer and drinks order and returned with our drinks promptly. Our appetizers were the Calamari $11 (excellent) and the Charcuterie $14 (very poor). Our dinner included the Bourbon Braised Short Rib $22 (good but not excellent), mashed potatoes (good), spinach (good); Beef & Ale $14 (awful, stringy, dry, tasteless), hashed sweet potatoes (tasteless); Tenderloin of Beef $29, (good but too ""chewy"" to be as good as it should have been). Our waitress inquired about our food, on learning that the Beef and Ale was awful she said she was ""sorry"" and would tell the kitchen. The plate was left uneaten on the table. At the end of our meal, she said she was sorry she hadn't noticed that the bus boy hadn't brought any bread to our table. She was pleasant and efficient when she was at our table....just not at our table often enough. A woman (manager or hostess ...not sure) came by to ask about our food, we told her the same....""OK all around except the Beef & Ale which was dry, tough and stringy"" she also said ""sorry"" and then asked us to ""fill our comment cards because they would appreciate our feedback.""  And still the uneaten food stayed on the table. Management: at a minimum, when a guest complains about food and a nearly full plate is still in front of them, tell your servers to find a replacement or simply strike it off the bill...no one likes to sit and watch the rest of their party eat while they pick at a terrible meal. No one wants to be charged for food they can't eat. This is Restaurant 101...not advanced thinking."
13941	73	3.0	1	2012-09-11	keep in mind...  princeton, nj.   there aren't too many places to eat out.  but, this place has got a lot of history and the food actually wasnt bad.  whoever made the prices were a little outta their mind though.  its pricey for the kind of food they are dishing up...  the crowd was mixed... but, i can see it catering mostly to an older crowd (your parents age and up).  prob would be a good place to take your parents if they were nice enough to drop you off and help you move into your dorm.
14017	73	3.0	1	2012-08-15	Good hidden bar for a drink in princeton. A lot of history to the place. I was turned off by our initial bar tender this girl who kept shooting us bad looks and ignored us. But the guy who helped us after about 7-8 minutes was super nice and told us a lot about the place. Another staff member offered us a packet with the history and it was cool to know how many famous people had been there. The crowd was mixed in age which was good.
14018	73	2.0	1	2012-08-08	Tucked away in Princeton, the Tap Room has the looks of an old tavern, huge portions, and mediocre food. The menu is very standard American - salads, sandwiches, burgers, and steaks - and the prices range from about $10 to $25 an entree.  My group shared crab cake sliders, the steak salad, and a French Dip sandwich.  The steak salad was the best of the group - very standard - and the rest of the food was just okay.  Nothing seemed very fresh and all the flavors seemed one note. The service wasn't very good either.  The waiter got our order wrong, and we were the only table in the restaurant.   We left the restaurant full, but not very satisfied.  When we're in Princeton again this won't be our place for a meal.
14019	73	3.0	1	2012-07-21	It was ok.
14020	73	1.0	1	2012-05-02	"This place would be adequate if the staff weren't rude and indifferent. We went for a birthday celebration and there was, literally, no one else in the restaurant. No one. It was 5:30 on a Tuesday and the place was dead. You would think that they would be eager to have our large party. But not so much. They wouldn't let us move chairs (!!!) or pull tables together (!!!!!) presumably to preserve them for the droves of high-rolling customers about to walk in at any moment. It's a rule, folks. Another rule is that you can't eat cupcakes for someone's birthday on the premises. You can pay a cake-cutting fee (for cupcakes) because that's the rule. The only time we had a staff member come to our tables (remember, not allowed to sit together) was to tell us not to eat the cupcakes. To order drinks and food we had to go to bar. Maybe that's also a rule. There are more rules than menu items at the Tap Room. In fact, I would say that the only thing ""historic"" about the Tap Room is that it is stuffy, rigid, and up-tight. Pass on it. There are better places nearby."
14021	73	1.0	1	2012-05-02	"This place is a ""historic"" hotel bar, by which you may suppose that you can enjoy the same mediocre food and indifferent service as our forefathers. I should point out that this is not entirely true. Although the current food and service is at least as mediocre and indifferent as it has always been (if not more so), it should be noted that the building itself is not historic. It is ""historic."" The current building was built in the 40s in a style that (and I quote from their website) ""...tells a story. The interesting contrast in the exterior design of the different wings is a delightful fancy of its architect, depicting ***the imaginary progress*** of a successful inn from the Eighteenth to the Twentyth [sic] Century."" In other words, it looks old, sells itself as historic but is not. I can't help but note that the Normal Rockwell mural is strangely appropriate in this context. I will ignore the shamefully early closing time and the sad way that it wastes what is otherwise prime patio real estate. If you are visiting from out of town, I highly recommend you skip this place, and walk across the street to Teresa's for dinner, or the extra 100 feet to the Alchemist and Barrister for drinks. Either option is highly worth the effort if you value tasty food, creative drinks, and most of all, reasonable service when dining more than you value the illusion of a historic experience."
14022	73	1.0	1	2012-04-30	As Princeton residents we have tried and tried to give the Yankee Doodle Tap Room plenty of opportunities to redeem themselves. Unfortunately this last trip there will def. be the last time. Such a shame because the setting, location, outdoor seating, etc. area are all amazing. The food isn't bad either. We have had great meals to just ok meals. The aspect that they are lacking is SERVICE! The service is terrible every time. There is never a hostess to be found. When you do find them they aren't super friendly. Servers move so slowly, never check up on you and are no where to be found. The most helper staff member there is the bar tender and I am pretty sure it isn't his job to be the hostess and a waiter too. Do not go there with kids since the service is too slow.  And as for just adults going out - well that was just as terrible too. So disappointing.
14023	73	3.0	1	2012-04-06	Typical pub fare. On this visit I had the French onion soup, and braised short ribs of beef with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The food was good but not spectacular. Service seemed a bit sluggish considering that the restaurant was not terribly busy at the time.
14024	73	1.0	1	2012-04-06	We came here after a day of touring NJ with four tweens and three adults.  We waited for 10 minutes to meet our waitress, she disappeared without taking our order or bringing bread or water or anything.  The bar tender and host were chatting ten feet away from us and staring.  I finally got up after 10 more minutes and asked if they could take our order and he ( the host) said a waitress would be out shortly and continued his chat.  She finally took our drink and food order.  She was obviously overwhelmed and the only one working.  The food came fairly quickly and was okay- just standard.  We will find somewhere else to eat next time we are in Princeton.
14025	73	3.0	1	2012-02-19	"We're out-of-towners.  I wanted to eat in here so I could see the autographed photo of Brooke Shields, the carved tables and the Norman Rockwell mural over the bar.  Yeah, I like Norman Rockwell, just like I like Turner Classic Movies, vintage stores, and ""Upstairs, Downstairs.""  Let's move on, shall we?   We had breakfast one time and drinks another time.  Breakfast was OK.  It wasn't very crowded.  We did get a nifty old booth all carved with initials.  Our waitress was nice and did a good job serving us.  The sausages and coffee were great.  The french toast was also good, although I recommend it without any type of fruit strewn over the top as the one of us who got it with fruit found it drowned in what seemed to be an entire can of warm Del Monte.  I would call this a three and a half star experience. Drinks...well, let's just say if the bar is that crowded on a normal night (and I'm guessing it probably is), they need more than two bartenders and they also need bartenders who hustle a lot faster.  I have been to a lot of bars and I think that was about the slowest I ever saw someone take an order, draw a beer and ring it up.  Most places I go would probably fire somebody who took that long.  So that was definitely a two-star experience.   Conclusion:  Eating there is OK but unless it's a really slow empty night, I suggest drinking someplace else."
14026	73	1.0	1	2012-01-02	Came here while visiting Princeton from out of town. Two overworked bartenders for the entire place on a Friday night, while a hostess and a couple of servers milled about doing nothing at the hostess' table. They told us we couldn't sit at one of the dozens of empty tables, though. It took forever to get a drink, and pretty much every patron was rudely and irritatedly jockeying for space at the bar. No thanks. Next time I'm in town I'll go somewhere else.
14027	73	2.0	1	2011-10-24	Gross overcooked tuna sliders, slick fries, bad service that rushes you even when there are no waiting customers and you're still eating. Don't even think about darkening the doors of this strictly average brew pub unless you are the finest university upper crust* (*visiting parents ok if sporting Chanel, Gucci or YSL..)
14028	73	1.0	1	2011-08-15	"Yes unfortunately my weekend of sub par experiences and awful bars continues. I was on my way home from Trenton this weekend when I got caught in the 100 year flood. Ok maybe it wasn't that bad, but it was pouring out, I was having trouble seeing, and I was getting annoyed so I decided I needed a beer. I went on my phone and saw what was in the area and the Tap Room looked pretty cool. So after parking down the street and sprinting through the pouring rain I arrived. The first thing I did was grab some napkins and wiped my face down since I was literally soaked through my shirt. Once I was done I put the stack of maybe 5 or 6 napkins down next to me at the bar. Pretty reasonable thing to do right? So the bartender walks up to me and I try to make some small talk. ""Man its raining out hard I had to stop and get a beer."" Her response with a cold look was what is this garbage? Really? Is that really the way you going to start are experience. I'm not in the mood and I it's not like I brought my trash from home and dumped it on the bar. It was a couple of bar napkins. I didn't want to let that ruin my whole experience so I tried to move on. She asked me what I'd like to drink and I wasn't quite sure. I asked her if I could try the Weyebacher. She responds to me once again with an attitude what do you mean try. Most bars let you try a small sample of the beer and if yours doesn't just let me know, but I don't need an attitude. So to finish my rant I guzzled me beer, left exact change, and walked out. I am a great tipper. I worked in a restaurant for 3 years. This woman did not deserve a dime of my hard earned money. On top of my experience the Tap Room seemed stuffy and unwelcoming. I looked at the menu and it was over priced and nothing special. I agree with Jessica other then the pictures of famous alumni on the wall this place makes you wish you never stopped."
14029	73	5.0	1	2011-07-19	"We found this place on YELP & wound up loving everything about it! The HISTORICAL nature of the place was my first interest (200 Year Old Tap Room Pub) and then when I saw that they were offering a coupon on YELP for 20% OFF - this sucked me in even more. (Note: After checking IN on FOUR SQUARE though, you actually get a FREE ENTREE with 1 bought, so that was even a BETTER DEAL! We went for Breakfast on a Saturday in the Summer, so the place was fairly dead, but that meant that we got GREAT service. The waitress was VERY accommodating & sweet to us. And she didn't mind at all when I switched from the YELP 20% off offer to the ""Free Entree Offer"" on 4SQUARE. I ordered the Blueberry Pancakes with Lemon Zest, which was absolutely PERFECT in every way, HOT, Fresh Blueberries, perfect amount of Lemon Zest within the 3 BIG pancakes and the pats of BUTTER are shaped like TULIPS....extra points for loveliness! My husband ordered the Salmon Benedict which was delicious and cooked perfectly. The poached eggs were really poached in boiling water (you could tell...) and the yolk was hard which is how my husband likes it, so that you can taste the Hollandaise sauce w/o runny yolk all over the place. My daughter got the cheeseburger sliders & fries, and everything about that was pretty awesome (I try what everyone is eating at the table....always!). The buns were a tiny bit dry on the burgers, that's the only bad thing that I'd say about the entire meal. AND Seeing the huge Norman Rockwell painting over the Bar and the pictures of old Princeton alumni (...including Michelle Obama & Brooke Shields) makes this place a lot more interesting than any other local Pub...."
14030	73	2.0	1	2011-07-10	Ambiance is great. Food was poor at best. Service was just ok
14031	73	1.0	1	2011-06-30	"I've been living in the area for over 5 years now and have spent many nights eating and drinking INSIDE the Tap Room without issue (besides the surly female bartender).  My group of friends has had 20+ people crowded around 3 tiny tables inside without a peep from a bartender, a waitress, or a manager. But OUTSIDE on the patio is a apparently a totally different place.  We arrived a bit past 8pm with a group of 4 and 2 more coming.  We were told we couldn't be seated outside even though there were plenty of free tables (4 tops) because the young male host told us we couldn't bring over extra chairs and they only have 1 table for groups (it was occupied).   2 of our group weren't planning on staying long so we just took the 4 top and sat down.  Then the 2 more people we were expecting arrived and must to our surprise the host brought over extra chairs saying, ""I don't really care if you sit here, they aren't my rules.""  Kudos to you guy for knowing how to make paying customers happy.  You're the only one at the Tap Room last night who did the right thing. Our waitress apparently hated us from the word go.  Again, it was well past the dinner hour for a Wednesday night (nearly 8:30 by now) but 2 of us ordered dinner and 2 ordered apps/sides, we all ordered drinks.  She then informed us in an incredibly rude way that she would only be bringing us the ONE round of drinks because we hadn't all ordered entrees.  Really?  Do they not understand that a bar bill can get a lot higher a lot quicker than a dinner bill?  When she brought our drinks she SLAMMED them down on the table making it even more clear she was not happy with us. The food is ok, I had a burger and they do a decent burger.  The fries are good but they aren't so good that they should come with a heaping side of attitude.   Another, unexpected friend stopped by and pulled up a chair.  I could see the waitress nearly having a fit in the corner when she saw this happen.  He asked for a glass of water (he doesn't drink at all) and she replied with, ""I'll have to ask my manager.""  She went and got the manager, I saw her talking to the woman and pointing at us.  The manager NEVER came to talk to us, the waitress just came back and said she couldn't serve a glass of water because we were ""over the limit of the table and a safety hazard"".  A ""safety hazard""?  We're on a patio outside, if a fire should start I'm pretty sure we can get away quickly.  Why are we a ""safety hazard"" with 7 at a 4 top table outside but we aren't a ""safety hazard"" with 20+ people around tiny bar tables inside?   Needless to say we were not very happy that our very un welcomed group was forced to give the waitress an 18% tip.  She certainly did not deserve one, she hardly did anything other than give us a bad time.   I get that the Tap Room's management came up with these policies and left it up to the servers to enforce them and while I think they are idiotic I think we were more offended by the waitress's incredibly nasty attitude towards us.  Had she said, ""look I'm sorry but these are the rules..."" and been nice about it we wouldn't have had an issue.  I also think the manager, since they obviously had such an issue with us, should have come over. I'm not naive enough to think that my review is going to change a darn thing, it's summer and the Tap Room is one of the few places in Princeton with a patio.  And I get that they likely don't want to be a place where people just go for drinks leaving diners no tables to sit at but I think they are being very short sighted.  Leave say half the tables opens for diners during dinner hours and half for just people wanting drinks.  You know what?  People drinking are very likely to order food!  Then once it gets past ""dinner time"" open it all up to whatever.  A&B gets this, Witherspoon Grill gets this, and now guess who is getting our business?   Had things gone a bit better at the Tap Room last night perhaps we wouldn't have left and taken our group of 7 to the Witherspoon Grill where they didn't mind if we sat on the patio and ordered just drinks."
14032	73	1.0	1	2011-05-06	"Been here a few times before for a sports bar feel, back before Princeton Sports Bar opened. All of my experiences here have been pretty average bordering on unsavory -- I've been harassed by their drunk patrons while with my boyfriend -- but tonight we've been subject to awful customer service and business model. We headed to Tap Room after dinner hoping to get drinks on their beautiful outdoor patio, but were turned away because apparently the patio is for dinner patrons only. Not even a ""if you come back later, we'll be open for drinks,"" never mind that the patio was largely desolate of clientele. They redirected us to some tiny 2-person ""bistro tables"" off to the side of the building, which had the feeling of being the sad corner table in the cafeteria where the school pariah sits by himself. We wavered for a while discussing alternative options, and finally the waiter who'd initially turned us away said that we could take a seat and just bring our own drinks from the bar. We were pleasantly surprised by his change in heart; we even confirmed twice that this would be okay and he said sure, it's been done before. So we were getting settled in our seats when another employee came over and told us we would have to leave if we weren't getting dinner. We explained that the other guy had said we could, but she just blanked us and repeated herself. You'd think she would have confirmed withe the other waiter and/or management, or be a teeny bit apologetic for the inconsistency in policy, but no... For the moment the only redeeming feature of the bar is the gallery of old-school alumni photos at the entrance."
14033	73	3.0	1	2011-03-21	The bar offers a club-like atmosphere and the big horseshoe bar sits in front of a large Normal Rockwell-attributed (it's unsigned) painting of Yankee Doodle that's fun to enjoy while having a pint on a Saturday Afternoon. Princeton is not a town of super-great bars, and this, the A&B and Triumph make the borough's first tier. Reasonably priced, never noisy or overly crowded--it's a great place to go with a few friends. The food here is pretty good--a big step above pub stuff. The composed salads are particularly nice.
14034	73	4.0	1	2011-01-08	The Tap Room is my go-to place in Princeton for drinks with friends.  I can always find a seat in the bar area and they have a fireplace and multiple tvs. The ambiance of the place feels like stepping into an old rustic ivy league bar with carvings on the walls and portraits of famous Princeton alums.  They have even extended their dining area onto a newly built patio in Palmer Square. The big advantage of the Tap Room is that you can get pitchers (unlike some of the other bars in Princeton), and the fact that it is never extremely crowded like The Ivy Inn, Triumph, and Winberries.  This is one of the few bars where you can actually have a conversation without having to yell.   The prices are better than most of the bars in Princeton and if you follow them on facebook and twitter, you can take advantage of 50 cent wings, $2 pints, and half price appetizer deals that they have, especially during big sporting events.  Although I cannot comment on the food, as I have mostly come just for the drinks, I have had the wings, which are pretty good. Overall, its a great place to hang out with friends in a warm relaxing atmosphere.
14035	73	3.0	1	2010-12-27	"Had a group of 7 people and the service was good. I like the atmosphere of the place - especially the HUGE fireplace at the back of the room. Nice to sit around with a cold beer and good conversation. Discliamer: Food is a subjective thing... like art. What appeals to me may not appeal to you. If something I've written intrigues you, take a shot and give a place the benefit of the doubt. You probably won't be disappointed. The food varied in quality. I started with the French onion soup. Nothing remarkable but good. I could get the same soup in the same bowl at a hundred different restaurants. The big, hearty burger was char grilled (a big plus) and is a generous portion. It was cooked exactly as i requested, was crusty, juicy, meaty  and well dressed. An 8 on a scale of 10. I asked for grilled onions and should have been more descriptive as I got sauteed/sweated onions. Caramelization on the onions would have provided deeper level of flavor and probably a higher rating. The Nassau (chicken) wings were average - not great but certainly not bad. Wasn't a fan of the dominant Worcestershire flavor in the Buffalo style and the BBQ wings were a little too ""gloppy"". Portions were generous. The sweet potato fries were good - a little on the thin side - and if a thicker cut had been used, would have made the fluffy inside that much better. Lastly, desert was good. We split the pumpkin bread pudding, cranberry apple crisp and the butterscotch pumpkin shooters. All were very good. I travel to Princeton at least once a year and would go to the YDTR if I craved a burger, a cold beer and a warm fire. So long from Texas."
14036	73	2.0	1	2010-10-24	My wife and I had lunch out on the patio to take advantage of a lovely warm autumn day. The newly renovated patio is beautiful, so that was definitely a highlight of our meal. Unfortunately we were disappointed with our food. The menu seems to revamped in an upscale direction -- we've been to Tap Room before for beers back when they used to give out free popcorn. All the salads seemed very impressive. I chose the cranberry chicken and my wife the beet salad. They were about 12$ each. We were offered some complimentary buns with a tasty garlic-pepper olive oil. We devoured them. When the salads came, we both found the quality of lettuces and greens to be wanting. I had to pick away some of the leaves that had wilted and were turning to green mush. The salads were large and filling, but mid to low quality ingredients and lack of attention to balance made them much less impressive than the menu suggests. We will not order salads from the Tap Room again. Though it was enjoyable to sit outside some extra time, it did take the server quite a while to give us our bill and we did have to ask twice. The service was fine, but a little more attentiveness would have been appreciated. I think the Tap Room has some ways to go to arrive at gastro-pub from pub.
10089	73	2.0	1	2010-10-22	The truffle /parm fries at the bar with some cold beers, good friends, and the game on any of the numerous tv screens= A+ I really wish I could give this place  a half a star. I hadn't been in a while, and went last night for a drink with friends, and the bartender was the rudest human being on the face of the earth. She snapped at us when we asked if we had to order at the bar. Then when we went up to order, she stood on the other end of the bar (where people were eating and it did not look like there was room for us to place our drink order) and then barked at us to come over there to order.  Then, when my friend gave her her license, she kept on questioning her license, since it was pretty beat up.   (my friend also carries her passport in case people don't believe that her license is legit- when presented with this, she snapped as well). I've never had such horrible service/attitude thrown my way. Definitely will avoid the place if that bartender happens to be working.
14037	73	2.0	1	2010-10-13	Did not like the service.  Took a very long time to get our order taken (after 25 minutes had to flag somebody down) and once the food came, some of the ingredients promised on the menu were missing from the food.  Will not be back!
14038	73	1.0	1	2010-09-13	"no increase in rating yet - but ""yet"" implies that there will be a next time. Nassau Inn management contacted us and refunded us the full price of our stay, plus offered to make it up to us with a complimentary night at the hotel including dinner AND breakfast at the YDTR. i gotta say - THAT'S customer service. I'm impressed."
14039	73	2.0	1	2010-07-30	I was staying at the Nassau Inn so I came downstairs for a quick breakfast before leaving.  As she was seating people, the manager kept asking if folks had coupons.  I showed her their 20% breakfast discount offered on Foursquare, and she had no idea what it was. The granola with fresh berries that I'd ordered was fine, as was the coffee, but my server was on the inattentive side...NOT good since I had less than 10 minutes to eat and pay.  I finally had to go to the hostess stand to pay, and the manager actually photocopied my phone for the Foursquare deal.  She couldn't figure out how to honor it in their computer system, so I wound up paying full price for the meal. Way to train your staff, folks.
14040	73	3.0	1	2010-07-28	"After a disappointing beer at Triumph we ventured on over to the Yankee Doodle.  The staff was much more welcoming and professional.  We sat at a table, had a beer (Sam Adams Summer) and ordered some food.  The clams and chorizo were delicious and my boyfriend enjoyed his burger.  Unfortunately the truffle parmesan fries were so atrocious we sent them back and we NEVER send anything back.   They were barely warm, barely dusted with parmesan, and not a hint of truffle on them.  To make it worse, they use those awful frozen, ""crispy"" fries...the ones that seem like there's a coating on them.  (I must be the only person on this planet that thinks it's a desecration of the potato.)  I don't expect them to have a staff dedicated to making fresh, hand cut, French fries but I expect better than what we got, especially if you're putting truffle & parmesan on them."
14041	73	4.0	1	2010-07-19	I've been here a few times.  The beer selection is pretty good, and the prices are reasonable for Princeton.  I like the sandwiches and the fruit salad with goat cheese is pretty good.  The service has been good each time I've been here, and it has a nice ambience.
7829	73	4.0	1	2010-06-27	The hubby and I have been to the Tap Room many times of the years but a few weekends ago we went for lunch out on the new patio. Because we've eaten there so many times, we were so surprised with the all new menu that was presented. Salads, sandwiches and more, there were many healthy options that sounded wonderful. The new patio looks like it's always been a part of this historic building which was especially nice. Comfortable seating and shaded with umbrellas made for a pleasant lunch. I ended up ordering the corn salad and it was fresh and delicious. My husband ordered the shrimp salad sandwich, which was also very good. The shrimp were huge and lightly coated, which was a plus. If you haven't been to the tap room recently, it's worth a new look.
14042	73	1.0	1	2010-02-06	"We went on Thanksgiving weekend and despite the ""special Thanksgiving menu,"" we left wholly unimpressed and thought it was nothing special at all.  My friend ordered the ravioli, which was really tasteless and bland, and arrived lukewarm in a tiny portion.   The waitress looked extremely busy, considering the place was packed that weekend, but it's hard to excuse when the service was so poor and I had to ask for the same thing three times.  Considering the price and the bland taste of the food, I would have at least expected bigger portions but we left unsatisfied and ended up eating a second mini dinner several hours later at home."
14043	73	2.0	1	2009-11-30	2.5 stars. Sure, it's probably a nice spot for a meal earlier into the evening, however Friday or Saturday night is an entirely different story (especially on Thanksgiving weekend). Too many people, too few bartenders, too much broken glass and spilled booze on the floor.
14044	73	3.0	1	2009-07-07	The chicken sandwich is very good, as are some of the desserts. Service can be slow and prices are a tad high, but overall, I like this place a lot and am always excited to go back. Don't forget to check out the original Rockwell mural behind the bar for a bit of history.
13066	73	2.0	1	2009-05-16	I was here Thursday evening as part of the Palmer Square Girls Night Out- they were offering $1 Bellinis. They had one bartender for a very busy night, and two managers walking around who could have jumped in to help but chose not too. The bartender was not very efficient or friendly. I hadn't been there in a long time and now understand why. There are other places in Princeton to go to in which you can get much better bar service. It does have great ambience and our waitress was nice and the food was pretty good, so these facts saved me from giving it one star.
14045	73	3.0	1	2009-01-02	We stopped here for breakfast this morning, which was surprising in its cost--about the same as every other breakfast place in town, platters being $9-12 for anything from eggs with bacon, sausage, or hash to waffles and pancakes.  Only here, the atmosphere is quieter and there's history everywhere.  The enormous Norman Rockwell mural is definitely worth the visit. The setting is great for a traditional, clubby university-type restaurant with the tables engraved with names.  I'm sure we scored no points with the hostess when my father-in-law (a Yalie) brought us over to the famous alum wall and commented that most of the people should be put in jail (adding that most of the famous Yalies should be similarly incarcerated). Efficient service, decent breakfast, excellent coffee.  Most of the banquettes and booths now have cushions, but there are plenty which remain hard wood.
11305	73	3.0	1	2008-07-07	"this is a tough one, really, great location / needs a couple old oriental carpets on the floor. excellent fireplace / totally cheesy gas flame ""fire"" it's a joke. has live bands / anything more than a guy with a guitar and it's WAY TOO LOUD for such a small place. free popcorn / maybe they'll clean the popper one day beers on tap/ too expensive hotel pricing. see what i mean? i do love the atmosphere but my old bones need something other than a hard wooden bench to sit on."
14046	73	3.0	1	2008-05-29	Once you are seated at the Yankee Doodle Tap Room you instantly feel smarter, richer, and whiter.  Just kidding.  I actually dig the Old Boy digs.  The food is good and the location is great.  I definitely think this place is worth checking out.
12739	73	2.0	1	2008-05-18	The YD Tap Room is part of the Nassau Inn.  They're going for the historic pub look/feel with wooden benches and tables and colonial pictures on the walls - and it works.  I don't really eat here as the only vegetarian options are salad or a Grilled Vegetable Napoleon.  I usually stick with the beer, but my friends have eaten the burgers and such.  As for the draft selection, you'll find Guinness, Sam, Blue Moon, Yuengling, and Stella on tap, as well as some combo of the nasty Bud/Miller/Coors.  TV's in bar for games and live music on weekends.
14047	73	4.0	1	2008-04-29	"I went here with my boss on one of my business trips to the east coast, and she informed me this was the restaurant that she and her husband had their first date. Awwww, quishquish.  :o) This place isn't bad!  We got to sit at a booth where princeton students who are apparently armed at all times with a ""carving item"" left their legacy in the wooden table and benches.  We both ordered steaks which were delightfully flavored, and treated ourselves to dessert.  Dessert was composed to ice cream, so I'm not giving YDTR any credit for that.  But it's a really cool chill spot with good food.  God Bless America!"
14048	73	4.0	1	2008-01-11	Enjoyed a fabulous Christmas dinner at the bar.  The salmon & duck were both perfectly prepared with delicious sauces.  We went back a few nights later for drinks.  Jill made a perfect martini.
14049	74	4.0	1	2014-10-10	Heard about Amelia's Restaurante from a Peruvian co-worker. It is Traditional Peruvian Seafood place. Big portions, very fresh and tasty. I highly recommend this place.
14050	4378	1.0	-1	2014-12-30	Last week , I'm order food x holy day's , the arroz con pollo was horrible , never combat again. ..
14051	4378	1.0	-1	2014-10-11	"My husband & I had dinner here today....1st time here, wanted to try something new. It was the worst decision. The food was nasty, the worst Peruvian food I've ever had. We ordered the anticucho & papa rellena for appetizers, jalea & lomo saltado for entrees. The meat in both the anticucho  & lomo saltado were overcooked & very salty. The seafood in the Jalea was not fresh at all & it tasted like they use frozen seafood & old oil to fry the seafood. The papa rellena's filling did not have any taste to it & the outer texture was hard like it was heated up in the microwave. The service was just as bad. Not once did they come to our table to ask if we needed anything or the usual: ""how's everything""? And we were ready to go we had to get their attention because they were busy on their cell phones. I'm Peruvian so I know about Peruvian cuisine & this was by far the nastiest food I've ever tasted!!!! We will never go back to this restaurant again. If you love great authentic Peruvian food you will stay away from this place. I had to click on at least one star because it wouldn't let me post without choosing a star but in reality I wouldn't give them a star at all!!!"
14052	4378	1.0	-1	2014-07-24	The service was so horrible that I had to open a Yelp account! I ordered chaufa, 1/2 of a chicken, sweet plantains, and yuca frita; everything lacked flavor, it was disgusting. The shrimp chaufa had no flavor, no color, and the shrimps were tiny and dry! The 1/2 of  chicken had a bad odor, I went back and told them is an old chicken and that it stinks! The 2nd chicken I got was the same, they need to get fresh meat! The yuca frita tasted like the Goya frozen ones you get at the frozen section in a supermarket and on top of that  no salt not even a pinch, and the sweet plantains tasted more like old re-used oil than a sweet taste. Everything went to the garbage! This place changed so much throughout the years, they went from a nice open booklet menu to a paper brochure menu, from a full house to an empty place. Everything makes sense now! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! You're better off going to Hiro's across the street or Cheveres in Passaic. Worst $25 spent in Santa Barbara!
14053	4378	1.0	-1	2012-03-26	Really disgusting place I was there on a Sunday and a lady yelled because she had a bug on her shoulder and another couple found a bug in there food it's very dirty never going back again
14054	4378	3.0	-1	2013-04-24	I've eaten here about three times and the food is good.  I wish the decor was a little nicer, but it's a good place to grab a casual sit-down lunch with no frills.
14055	4378	4.0	1	2014-12-23	The food was incredibly good and it was in a good street and we had a great peruvian breakfast ,the service was ok , have parking, I  don't  like the decorations looks little bit desorganising ...I'll come back definitely. ....
14056	4378	2.0	1	2014-09-29	Went here for a dinner with a friend last Friday night. The food was alright, nothing special at all. The chaufa rice was decent, the chicken with french-fries was alright. The salad dressing was nasty. The service was alright, but again nothing special.  Not a place that I would visit again.
14057	4378	1.0	1	2014-08-27	The food is ok and pricey.  They use to be better on quality.  Most of all seafood if frozen.  They do have good coffee.
14058	4378	3.0	1	2014-07-27	Just left here and it isn't the best but isn't the worst. It's kind of in between, I had shrimp in garlic sauce with a side of rice. The rice was bland and a little over cooked and the shrimp was okay, it didn't really stick out. The service was pretty good. And the good wait time was short BUT my meal didn't come out very hot it was lukewarm.
14059	4378	4.0	1	2014-07-21	This place is awesome.. And as a Chilean that is all I am going to say about it haha. But seriously it is great food.
14060	4378	2.0	1	2014-02-28	This place used to be so much better a few years ago. They either changed cooks or got cheap on the ingredients but went there 2 times in the last couple of months and the food was no longer good. The food lacked flavor and was cold and yes very slow service! It's a shame because they used to be really good.
14061	4378	1.0	1	2013-11-09	Decided to grab some ceviche and it's the worst ceviche I've had in my life.   I don't think I'll be returning.   Some other reviewer said that they found a fly on their food not surprised.   The reason why the ceviche was horrible was because it looked like the ceviche was kept frozen for days.  Don't come here if you're looking for true Peruvian food.  Have some respect and treat your stomach right.   El peor ceviche que e probado en mi vidal. Sinceramente, Un buen cevichero
10148	4378	2.0	1	2013-07-28	Not a bad place if you are in the mood for quick bite of peruvian food. I stopped going here after i found a dead fly in my food. After about 2 years i tried them again. No dead bugs this time. Have had better peruvian. But if you have time to spare travel to clifton, paterson  or kearny. They have nice peruvian places there.
14062	4378	3.0	1	2013-03-05	I've been craving ceviche for some time now so a patient of mine recomended this place for me. She told me that it was really good, but needless to say it didn't live up to it's expectations. The food was a bit pricey and the ceviche wasn't as fresh as the ones I've had in the past. The papa la huancaina was good tho, as well as the purple corn drink. The service was pretty good and welcoming. They have parking in the back, but if you luck out you might have to park your car on the streets and hope nobody breaks into it.. Lol not sure if I would come back here.
14063	4378	5.0	1	2011-06-15	I had been craving peruvian ceviche for a while and wanted to try a local spot.  I ordered the mixed ceviche and papa a la huancaina.  It was deliciouso! The service was fast and attentative. The only down is that the servings were not large enough to take some home. I am used to going to peruvian restaurants that give you extra large servings.
14064	4378	5.0	1	2011-04-02	I was starving after a 5 hour bus ride so I asked my buddy for some good healthy food - Im tired of all the sandwich places, fried food and etc. He said how about ceviche?   Perfect -  I had the mixed ceviche (fish, octopus and squid) Amazing!!!!!!! served with peruvian corn, sweet potato and reg potato Service was excellent. Also don't forget to try the purple corn juice?  This was the finishing touch I will definetly be a regular here !!!!
14065	75	2.0	1	2014-02-25	Generous two stars!   I guess Julio is giving it another try at this new Mt. Pleasant location.  A friend and I had dinner there recently and we were not at all impressed.  The decor was drab and outdated, although it was new, and the bar was cheaply done.  The food was average at best.  We had veal parmigiana which was much better then the tortillini in Alfredo sauce.  We also ordered a bottled beer and fountain soda from the bar and it was 9 dollars!  Too much for a place like Julios!
14066	75	5.0	1	2014-02-20	I come here often when I'm in NJ and I assure you this establishment is a gem. I don't know what Ash K. problem is, perhaps she's just accustomed to eating her own 'home cooked' canned microwave food (I don't eat that so I wouldn't know what it tastes like) and wouldn't know what real sauce tastes like if it hit her in the mouth, but I have yet to get anything that tasted like it was microwaved or canned.   The people that work there are very attentive. It's a small family owned business so it can get a bit crowded but I've always enjoyed myself there and meeting all the people at the bar. Friendly atmosphere, great food and the gentleman at the bar is always very kind to us and tells great stories.
14067	75	2.0	1	2012-07-22	We went last night greater not friendly. Had reservation tried to sit us at bar area very noisy. Most food ok ravioli light it was in canned sauce. Never refilled water. Would not go back again  much better restaurantts
14068	4973	1.0	-1	2013-07-15	I give this 1 star, not because the bagels aren't great....they are.  But, having been going there on a regular basis, I have NEVER received good service.  The people who work there go about whatever they are doing and ignore a customer waiting.  Even after saying what I want, the people who work there will stop and continue a conversation (unrelated to bagels) before going over and putting my bagels in a bag.  I am shocked that they give SUCH poor service, when all I want to do is go in, ask for a few bagels to be put in a bag, pay and leave.
14069	4973	1.0	-1	2013-02-27	This place has the WORST customer service I have ever experienced.  After ordering there for months I have had enough.  The girl that answers the phone is extremely rude.  Then when they make a mistake on your food, they yell at you hang up on you and pretty much say F you we don't need your business.  Well in that case you no longer have my business and I hope a lot of other people stop going there as well!  The only reason I gave it one star is because it wouldn't let me put my review through with 0!
14070	4973	1.0	-1	2013-02-27	Most Horrible customer service imaginable! They screwed up on an order and when we called in to let them know, Mind you we called the first time with no attitude and we weren't even angry, but they yelled at us and told us we were wrong, although i KNOW i wasn't (they've screwed up before) and hung up three times. Unbelievable. How hard is it to just remake one sandwich? Hell I would have even paid for the correct one if they let me. And im sorry WHY do they have 3 sandwiches with the same name!? They have no idea what there daily lunch specials actually are or what is in there sandwiches. They've lost several customers for sure!
14071	4973	5.0	-1	2013-06-23	This place is out of this world. You expect Alice and Mel but you get great food. Great bagels. So so service. Great prices. Great jersey feel.  Owner is a character.  They care about food quality and freshness. Definitely go back.
14072	4973	3.0	1	2014-10-13	As said previously it's a solid bagel place but sometimes service is meh. I work pt at a nearby office and have a coworker who has an affinity for ham cheese and butter sandwiches so on occasion she asks me to pick one up for her. The chick that works the front counter just seems so not into being there it's hard not to notice it. She seems like she's pretty good at her job but really just throw on a smile and say have a nice day...it takes so little effort to be nice.
14073	4973	4.0	1	2014-05-23	We use them as an everyday lunch caterer in our office. The food is very good, fresh and always on time.  we've been using them for a little over two years and have no plans to stop.
14074	4973	4.0	1	2014-03-08	This is the best bagel place! Friendly staff, clean, great bagels, good quality sandwiches. Delicious coffee too!
14075	4973	1.0	1	2014-02-25	Ewww!!! My experience today sucked!!!! I feel very pissed and offended -- what an unprofessional and rude business!! They got my order wrong, and was very rude after I called them about their mistake....they are very non-apologetic, and asked me to wait another 40 minutes before they deliver my panini and pick up the wrong order....When I asked for a refund, they asked me to calculate for them how much it is going to cost...Can you imagine that? ?!! The manager Willy refused to correct their mistake, and refused to transfer me to their owner Jeff to file a complaint. Such a horrible experience -- now I totally lost my appetite and I would never ever go back to this place again. To take further actions, I need to file a complaint with the better business bureau. Do not go to this place, they will mess up with your order and act very rude on the phone!! They need to train their staff about attitude, work etiquette, English, and math!!! Horrible food too --- my order looks and tastes like leftover dog food - DRY AND COLD AND NAUSEATING. YIKES!!!
14076	4973	1.0	1	2013-04-28	"I went in there hungry, left not hungry and no food bought. The 2 girls at the counter have these disgusting pins in their face. It turned my stomach. By the time i was asked if they could help me, I said ""Never mind. I'm not hungry anymore."" The manager asked what the problem is. I told him that I can't believe that you run a business where the help that you hire are in desperate need of facial attention. He told me to leave, so I did. Maybe this new owner should take a customer management relations course and get down to earth."
14077	4973	5.0	1	2013-04-14	Best Bagels in the area! Brings me back to being a kid and walking to the local bagel store for a hot bagel out of the oven. They are big and fluffy on the inside with a nice crust outside. Made on site which you don't see anymore by the chains. Sandwiches are great too. Breakfast or lunch.
14078	4973	4.0	1	2012-04-25	Have been ordering from four j's for years.  The roast beef sandwiches are excellent.  Few issues with getting the orders correct....overall very good.
14079	4973	3.0	1	2012-02-24	"I gave 3 stars because the food at this place is A-OK! Bagels, sandwiches, coffee, all good! Go and you won't be disappointed. BUT NOW, I NEED TO RANT! I'm starting to believe, IT'S JUST ME! Have i been spoiled from my years of living in NY that i am expecting too much from NJ food joints? I DON'T THINK SO BC I'VE FOUND A FEW GOOD ONES, but the majority of places JEEZ! I very simply order an american cheese omelette and a toasted whole wheat bagel lightly buttered. The guy writes it on the pad. Let me give you a visual, 2 dudes sitting down at table are eating & one dude aside from myself is standing waiting for his order to-go. I start looking around, first at the ceiling above the grill, why is there dust covering that ceiling? i think it's safe to assume some of that dust may get in my food, no? then i pan to the left, about 6 severely stained ceiling tiles, why are these like this? you can tell they've been that way for a while too. One ceiling tile is slightly lifted w/ a bird's nest of cable wires coming out going to a TV on top of the snapple fridge. Why couldn't they cut a small notch in one of the tiles and done this more neatly? About 7 minutes pass, the guy who took my order says ""hey buddy, did you order?"", you've got to be kidding. I smirk and say ""yeah!"", few more minutes goes by, a girl comes to the register w/ my platter, i walk to the register and ask ""is my bagel in the platter?"", her response ""your TOAST will be right out!"", hmmmm, maybe she just meant my bagel was in the toaster, NOPE!!!! a few seconds later i see 2 slices of toast come out of the toaster, another worker begins buttering them. I say, ""i was supposed to get a whole wheat bagel."" The girl and butter boy both look at me as if i had 7 heads. Finally the dude from the grill (he must be an owner) walks over, quickly butters my bagel, wraps it and says ""sorry!"", i say ""no worries"" and leave. By no means will i stop going here, but i'm wondering, IS IT ME?"

The only reason I give this place four instead of five stars is because a couple of times, they've given me a wheat bagel instead of a whole wheat everything bagel, which is annoying. The bagels and cream cheese are worth it though.
14081	4973	4.0	1	2010-08-24	This is a great little bagel place. They have a pretty large sandwich menu and the few that I've tried have been really good, coming with a side of coleslaw and a pickle. I've gotten a bagel with cream cheese a few times, and the low fat veggie cream cheese is SO GOOD and fresh! They don't have all those weird bagels you can get at some places (you know, french toast, banana ham, cinnamon bacon) but if I want a bagel, I want a bagel. Poppy, sesame, pumpernickel- I'm old school like that. The size of the bagels is also perfect. Big enough to satisfy but not the size of my steering wheel. I took off one star because I tried to get lox and a schmear the last time and they had no lox. That's not right.
14082	77	4.0	1	2014-04-12	Good food.. like the lunch special until 3 all combos are a lil cheaper and it's for all 7 days if the week , no delivery.. Chicken wings, Beef and Chicken and broccoli in garlic sauce have all been good when I have eaten here
14083	77	5.0	1	2014-04-09	The food is good. It gets busy because alot of people are ordering at the same time,usually busiest Friday's thru Sunday's 11am-11pm. Other days you can have food done on less than 11 minutes. It's take out orders ,or you can have it delivered. My favorite dishes Is with chicken. The food is tasty and reasonable! Another favorite is a sesame seed chicken with fried shrimp,  yummy! They have delicious lunch specials usually around five dollars.
14084	77	4.0	1	2014-02-23	Finally!  Found a place with awesome food & fast service...thank God!  Not to mention, inexpensive.
14085	78	5.0	1	2015-01-07	Love this place!
14086	79	1.0	-1	2014-05-28	"The service here is horrendous. My family of 9 (plus a wheelchair, plus 4 strollers and a walker for my mother) felt not only unwelcome, but utterly terrorized when we were informed that we musn't block the entrance due to some ridiculous ""fire regulations"".  Next, the waitstaff told us that our family has to sit at two separate tables, because they have what they claim to be ""dinner reservations"". This is where i drew the line, saying that we might be poor, but we love eachother dearly and will not be separated at a German restaurant. We therefore gathered all the available chairs around the table to which we were so rudely assigned, and proceeded with our order. After a brief consultation, the 9 of us settled on sharing one roasted sausage (Bratwurst),  7 bread baskets, and tap waters all around. The piece de resistance, however, was when I was forbidden to consume the sandwich that I brought with me. (I have to eat my own food at restaurants, ever since I found out on Dr. Oz that I'm gluten intolerant.). The audacity they had denying me my meal is inexpressible. They also refused to comp any deserts (despite my gluten intolerance, I can have a Klimttorte every once in a while). They also charged us for 3 (three!) bread baskets.   In short, we had a terrible experience, and they should really change their policies or we will never set foot (nor wheel) in this place ever again."
14087	79	1.0	-1	2013-08-19	SO RUDE!!! They say people in NYC are rude, but I've never felt that way, until I walked into Café Sabarsky. My friend and I ordered full breakfast, followed by their famous apple strudel. After we finished our food and drinks we kept sitting at the table, talking and catching up. We were served the bill without asking for it, which in itself is a common NYC custom, so I had no problem with it., but the waiter came back 4 times (!!!)  asking if we are ready to pay. We were sitting in the Cafe not more than 25 minutes when the Manager came up and told us that house rules were that you are not allowed to sit more than 20 minutes if you're not ordering more food... It was getting very unpleasant, and our conversation was interrupted too many times, so we payed and left. There was a small line at the door of people waiting for tables, but why kick out paying customers in favor of others? I didn't come for the food (its not that great) - I came to enjoy the atmosphere and have conversation. How rude to kick out paying customers! What comes to mind: Café Sabarsky is inside a German/Austrian museum and the manager's attitude did feel like he was inspired by the Nazi era. We will never set our foot in there again.
14088	79	1.0	-1	2009-04-15	I was brought up in Europe in places like this. When it opened, it was great. Then they decided to let the Japanese tourists take over all the tables, two order one piece of cake and share and they drink tap water. Trying to look very 'gemutlich', they will sit reading an intelligent looking book and stay for a few hours while the line gathers round Central Park and the Austrian/Deutsch Maitre D doesn't want to appear rude and tell them to piss off. Went last week for dinner, after staying away for 6 months. The dinner menu has gone, the food was mediocre, they have half the service as previous and they ran out of  Sacher Torte at 6p.m. !! Half a bottle of sour white wine was $29 but the water was free and we got to see a lot of Japanese sharing a piece of cake, drinking tap water , taking photos of their plates and looking very Austrian and serious. Bye Bye Sabarsky and I know Lauder is cheap but I would have thought he would draw the line at Strudel Kaput Cafe.
14089	79	2.0	-1	2014-02-23	I chose to eat at Cafe Sabarsky on a Sunday. It was a long line at the entrance. Obviously they work on a first came first serve base, without a waiting list. My experience was ok from all points of view, but it was not excellent. It`s a a single room with many tables. Interior design wise, nothing spectacular: old marble table tops (which by the way should be replaced since the edges are chipped), a sophisticated  millwork (but poorly finished). The food was enjoyable but in a petite size at a large price; I was not impress by its taste, nor its presentation. I will definitively not return for the food itself. The service was ok, but not remarkable. They just did they job right, but lake the friendliness. The dessert was disappointing: a very mediocre strudel at a place where strudel suppose to be at its peak. For your chef there: please learn how to properly do it; if I would like to have a cooked dough with fresh apple I would just bite the apple. Conclusion: it`s on your own risk, depending on how trained and  sophisticated tastes you have.
14090	79	2.0	-1	2012-04-02	Cute little Austrian cafe. We waited in line for 30 min to get into the cafe. Once we got in, we were seated at a nice window booth. The desserts, especially the sachertorte, were delicous! However, we thought the price for the coffee was way to expensive $6 a cup. It was good coffee, just not really worth the price. If we had not waited in line for so long and the prices for coffee were maybe a dollar or two lower, I would have rated this place higher. Waiting 30 min and paying $25 for two coffees and one dessert, just wasn't worth it.
14091	79	3.0	-1	2014-05-21	good coffee
14092	79	3.0	-1	2013-04-01	"Sabarsky is much prettier and perhaps a bit less noisy. Coffee is the best in NJ. Goulash soup and yummy cake are hits. You really feel as if you are in Europe
14093	79	2012-12-05	too good
14094	79	2011-06-11	After the exhausting trip to the MET for the McQueen exhibition, my friend and I decided to take the kids to the Neue Gallery which was closed when we got there. Instead, we stayed at the cafe and tried out their food and coffee. I had the white asparagus soup and the kids shared the weisswurst with bretze. Everything was good but not soo super delicious for $14 a soup. I thought coffee could also be better for a Viennese Cafe. Our server was attentive and he really managed us well with our 3 kids. Would go back for desserts and the ambiance.
14095	79	2014-08-11	This space is gorgeous and really unique for the city.  Reading the other reviews, you understand that you come for the atmosphere not the food.  Everything at a more reasonable price (breakfasts and cold plates) tastes fair, and the sad truth is you have to spend a lot to have anything decent.  We finally discovered this after spending over $120 on dinner for 2. Hungarian Goulash is delish, but we'll keep returning for the coffee and torte.
14096	79	2014-07-31	Such a beautiful restaurant to dine in. I absolutely loved the salmon avocado salad. The decor is really fitting and the ambience is great.
14097	79	2013-08-19	ad vocem Sopia T's review: I don't really know if they served Apfelstrudel in concentration camps. Or at least not on a daily basis. And if they did, I'm sure it was so stale that it must've sparked riots, or something... Anyway, this is just a speculation on my part, as I was never exeptionally strong in history (I'm sure Sopia T can relate). On a different note: I totally understand that no NYC restaurant will let you hold a table if there are people waiting in line and you're not ordering. It's not even a question of protocol, it's common courtesy on the guest's part, for Christs sake! Also, I'm a frequent guest at Sabarsky and I consider equating the house policy of the restaurant to the Nazi party line as low, untactful and insultng. I'm really hoping that Sopia T. will keep her word and never come to Sabarsky again.
14098	79	2012-11-17	Like most people I find the Viennese ambiance enticing.  It is a bit pricey but someone has to pay for the wood panelling.    The quality of the cakes is good even if not worth the price.  The goulash is good but expensive.   Wish they had more hot food as there isn't a lot to choose from for main courses.  Check the opening times before going.
14099	79	2012-07-23	Very European and cool. Lovely Austrian menue, on the over-priced site. Great service. The only problem- some times the wait is too long. The museum is also worth seeing. I always go there with my guests from Europe. It's our island on the other site of the Atlantic. And they used to speak German there. Love the newspapers, the flowers and and the music. Great ambiance! Everything that transports you to old Europe.
14100	79	2012-04-16	I absolutely loved the food, especially the pastries... And the staff was really nice, but the food!! I am SO GOING BACK!
14101	79	2012-03-15	We found this cafe one day after a delightful afternoon visiting the Whitney.  It has a wonderful, cozy European atmosphere.  I wish there were more places like this in the city.  The coffee was rich and tasty and my friend said her hot chocolate was divine.  We shared an apple strudel that was devoured in minutes.  I'll definitely be back.
14102	79	2010-10-19	Of all the traditions one would leave behind when coming from Europe, an afternoon Kaffee und Kuchen, I could not bear to sacrifice. I come to Cafe Sabarsky for a quick lunch or 4pm pick-me-up. The menu is authentic, though slightly inconsistent. As an example, the Goulash is lacking and the desserts...well it's hard matching to what I am used. However, the service is top. Waiters are intelligent, multilingual and prompt. If not for this, I would give a three star review. All considered, I do recommend.
14103	79	2010-07-27	Great sausages! Erin Pondo
14104	79	2009-06-05	Food is spectacular and the Viennese coffee is just worth making the trip uptown!!!! The service is on the iffy side, not very attentive but I do like the eclectic crowd here. Down to earth Artsy and old time New Yorkers. Breathtaking interior too!  Feels like your took a train ride and ended up in some classic european cafe society parlor painted by Gustav Klimt. Check out the art nouveau-esque cafe in the basement if the lines are too crowded upstairs especially on the busy weekends. The food is the same and it's less chaotic than it's sister cafe upstairs.
14105	79	2009-03-25	Very expensive but worth it if you have visited Vienna and really miss the coffee houses there.  This was the case with us and we were not disappointed.  The dobostorte and linzertorte were devine and just what we had been longing for!
14106	79	2008-10-12	I don't stand on line because I don't believe in it. But I stood on line for about fifteen minutes last weekend to score a table at Cafe Sabarsky and I'm glad I did. Don't ask me why, but it probably had something to do with an intense need for a euro-fix. Cafe Sabarsky, the in house canteen at the Neue Gallery on Fifth Avenue, is about as European as you can get without a passport. If they accepted Euros for payment, I wouldn't blink. Like a Viennese grand cafe - sans the smoking - CS is a treat for the tongue and eyes. Recent Austrian newspapers - like the Kurier - hang on racks just as you'd find in Salzburg or Vienna. Austrian and German beers and wines are available, good espresso and a not half bad Sachertorte is on offer. Great people watching, pretty room, efficient friendly service and worth another visit.
14107	79	2013-12-24	I just read a couple disparaging reviews about this place that I was surprised at. I think that it is a great place, and I always recommend it to people visiting from out of town. It has such a nice atmosphere. I love it. It's very nice. I think the problem is that some people are looking for what they know and this is different. Colleen C. thinks it is going to be super cheap or something. It's Manhattan New York. In consideration of that, I think the prices are ok. This other dame Jenn T. is complaining about rudeness, but she doesn't really say what was so rude. She doesn't know what those tables were for. I think that she is right in thinking that her problem was more specific to her, which makes me just like the place more! hahahahaha I really like Cafe Sabarsky, because it is not a pig out slobby American Applebees kind of place. I think that was what Jenn and Colleen C. was looking for, but Colleen probably wanted a Pizzaria UNO, which I also love, but she could brake out the coups.
14108	79	2013-08-16	I'd like to protest in the strongest possible terms against the treatment that Mr./Ms Jay B encountered at Cafe Sabarsky when confronted by the manager, whose name I will not mention. It is beyond outrage that such a refined guest, who weaves the narrative of their review with fluency and grace worthy of The New Yorker, be subjected to the aforementioned impertinence. Nobody deserves such abuse, and least of all not someone who can use the word whilst"" in a way that causes the reader to stop, think, and for at least a moment feel inferior to the learned author of the review. Furthermore, I was as deeply touched by Jay's sincere concern for Ronald Lauder's properties, as I was alarmed by the philanthropist's alleged carelessness regarding the liquidity of his own assets. I would like to take this opportunity to strongly suggest that Mr. Lauder be briefed without delay on who really frequents the establishment, and who, as a result, is forced to wait in line for an insultingly tiny portion served on an even smaller table. I actually believe that the reason for using small tables in Sabarsky is to make the portions seem bigger, but I here I actually might be wrong (Perhaps Jay B. and I should investigate this issue further). As I've learned from a well-informed source, the nature of the castings used to staff Chef Gutenbrunner's restaurants, as well as the design of the staff's uniforms still remain a subject of an ongoing debate, which aims at accommodating  the sensitivities of as many guests as possible. I'd like to believe however, that all contributing opinions are welcome, and that all will be used to to improve the overall quality of the otherwise unique dining experience at Cafe Sabarsky."
14109	79	5.0	-1	2012-12-28	I usually don't bother to write reviews, but after today's visit to Cafe Sabarsky I really feel compelled to write a few words. It is a unique place with wonderful ambiance, great food and quality service. If you're there for lunch or dinner, make sure not to miss the schnitzel, which I believe is among the finest items on the menu. It was beautifully prepared and artfully plated, as were the other dishes on our table: my friend ordered the frankfurters in goulash sauce, which looked so seductively, that she didn't know whether to eat  them or give them a ride home ;) For dessert I had a cafe creme (espresso with hot cream) and a delicate lemon mousse cake, which added a delightful note of playfulness to my otherwise hearty and decadent indulgence. The servers were attentive, professional and helpful, and what is perhaps most remarkable, were able to maintain a friendly and positive demeanor despite working for what seems to be many hours in this high-volume and high pressure environment. One other thing that needs to be mentioned: think twice before bringing your kids along. Cafe Sabarsky is not a very kid-friendly restaurant. They have no high-chairs, no kids' menus and very little tolerance for loud, disruptive, undisciplined and misbehaving children. The layout of the place makes it difficult to accommodate strollers and baby-carriers. From what I've seen, any attempts to negotiate these issues with the staff are doomed to fail. Overall, a really great place. Five stars. I strongly recommend visiting.
14110	79	5.0	-1	2012-10-08	What a wonderful experience! The food is so good you have to savor everybite. The atmosphere is elegant and charming, and I wouldn't consider it stuffy. They would probably appericiate that you don't go rollin up in your sweat pants with a bunch of kids that are out of control, but I'd say most upstanding estabishments would. Our meal was very reasonable too: two entrees,two desserts, an appitizer, a take home treat of chocolate covered almonds and tip was $60.
14111	79	5.0	-1	2012-03-31	"**GUEST WRITER** Salvador Dali is mad played out.  You see that melting clock s*it on three-quarters of all dorm room walls, usually either right next to a Phish poster or right below an actual clock that doesn't work because the batteries are dead.  Aside from melted clocks, though, everything he does is crazy obscene for no good godd*mned reason. I watched Un Chien Andalou once sophomore year with a bunch of stoned people, and it seemed like some bullsh*t too.  Unless you're ready to be extremely enthusiastic about shockingly vulgar nonsense, there's no point.  When I explained this to a friend, she commented, ""[s]o basically he was like the guy from jack*ss, but a long time ago.""  Right on.  George Orwell said, ""his talent ends at his elbow.""  That's not bad either. Café Sabarsky is too good to be on Yelp.  Never had anything that wasn't delicious, from salads to main courses to coffee to dessert.  Just go."
14112	79	5.0	-1	2011-12-21	"The beauty of New York is that if you look hard enough, you are able to find a taste of almost anywhere in the world. Cafe Sabarsky is one of my favorite places to go to in NYC. Each time I have gone there, whether it is for a quick coffee and dessert or for treating special people to what is in my opinion an out of this world dining experience, I have always left with nothing less than a smile on my face or the satisfaction to have been able to have shared with someone what I consider to be one of the hidden gems of this city. The atmosphere, the decor, the service, the impeccable attention to detail, are all reasons that keep me coming back when I need a break from the high pace and the ""I want it good, I want it cheap and I want it now"" attitude that us New Yorkers become accustomed to, and sometimes makes us forget that quality takes time and time is worth money. The desserts are absolutely divine. The coffee is addictive. The food is delicious. The wine is amazing. Cafe Sabarsky is perfectly Austrian, perfectly perfect; and perfection speaks for itself."
14113	79	5.0	-1	2011-11-23	As an Austrian living in New York, I  can say, this is the best Austrian food outside of the country. I try to come here whenever I'm in the area, which unfortunately isn't too often. The atmosphere is above average, but not amazing. It lies somewhere between casual, and classy, with both being acceptable. If you have some extra time, I recommend you check out the Neuegalerie (If you enjoy art of course) The food is nothing short of amazing. I won't recommend a specific food, but you cannot go wrong with a Wiener Schnitzel, as there is a reason it's the most famous. Just make sure you know what you're buying before you do, as some other people reviewing this place clearly haven't. The Desserts are what you'd expect...amazing. I'll go ahead and just recommend everything, but once again, make sure you know what you're buying. In conclusion, it's definitely worth it. I'm not a fan of pricy restaurants, but some, like this one, are worth it. The best Austrian food in the US, and better than a lot in Austria itself. Give it a look if you're in the area
14114	79	5.0	-1	2010-04-17	I had a chocolate cake and a coffee. The cake was one of best chocolate cakes I have ever had. Smooth, chocolatey,... Unfortunately one has to wait to be seated, but it is worth the wait. Just great!
14115	79	5.0	-1	2008-04-04	This place defines what a coffee house should be.  The decor reminds me of old Vienna.  The service was very good.  The coffee is supreme and bold.  There is sometimes a wait but always fast and worth it. Pro:  A wide selection of tasty desserts.  The coffee is supreme and classic.  They give you a cup of water also.  The lunch options are very good too.  Nice atmosphere. Con:  Nothing really. Overview:  Would go back to just relax and enjoy.
14116	79	5.0	-1	2007-06-29	Loved it!!! Scallops and aspargus..my vegetarian child even was tempted to try this dish. Lovely service...delicious Sabarsky Torte...great coffee.....
14117	79	4.0	1	2015-01-05	Nice atmosphere. Very good Spaetzle and Wurstsalad. Desert was also very delicious.
14118	79	2.0	1	2015-01-04	My family and I were excited to find a German café while on vacation in New York. We waited in line for 45 minutes to get seated - waste of time and money. The food was below average. The prices were high. Portions were small. The waitstaff was rather snooty. Being Polish and very fond of German food, I had much higher expectations for a place like this.
14119	79	5.0	1	2014-12-29	I love love love Cafe Sabarsky! My ultimate fave is the hot chocolate and pistachio cake! Beautiful ambiance great service always a pleasure going there for a nice treat!
14120	79	4.0	1	2014-12-10	Cafe Sabarsky, inside the Neue gallery, feels like an old world Austrian cafe where you might go to discuss philosophy and drink sherry. Go on a rainy winter's afternoon. Order the chocolate cake with rum and a coffee, and sit and chat on the comfortable banquettes amidst wood panneling and the bar reminiscent of Buenos Aires for hours.
14121	79	4.0	1	2014-12-06	We had some tasty goulash and brat worst, with Sabarsky mocha and Mozart-torte. The food was good and environment fairly nice. We did have a 30 minute wait and we were lucky because people came after us had a much longer wait. The food was good but not great - and a bit pricey for the small quantities. The goulash was more of an entrée than a meal for $16 and the bratwurst as well (boiled not roasted). The coffee was a shot of expresso with whipped cream for $8. The total for two small dinners, one coffee and one desert was $54 before tip - essentially for a snack. We might come back once a year.
14122	79	3.0	1	2014-12-05	This place is located near all the Museums. GF and I were visiting the Met and wanted to find a bite to eat where we could sit down close by. Found this place on yelp, and noticed all of the great reviews. There are actually two restaurants in the Neue Galarie Museum which offer the same menu. The one upstairs had a longer line, so we opted to eat in the basement restaurant. We had about a 10 minute wait until we were seated. The menu is short and to the point. GF and I opted to split the bratwurst and the open faced salmon sandwich. Both were delicious, standard Austrian fare. I had a 1/2 bottle of Austrian wine which I can't remember the name of (writer fail). Service was ok. They took our order, brought our food, and then brought us the bill. At no point in time did anyone ask how we were doing, or if we wanted anything else. If you're looking for traditional German/Austrian food then this is a good place to go.
14123	79	3.0	1	2014-12-02	Hey, we all need a place to take a discerning friend for a fancy coffee! The desserts are all perfectly good but honestly, the only only reason to visit the cafe is for the pseudo- European atmosphere. If a luxurious decor and snooty waiters enhance your enjoyment of a $9 coffee then this place is for you! The service is stern and efficient. Don't expect to linger over your drink - the waiter will slip the bill on your table the moment your plate is cleared.   Expect long waits during peak times. However, there are often free tables in the second cafe in the basement. While lacking the beautiful carved wood panels of the main cafe, this room as a cool early 20th century modernist vibe. Be warned: the chairs in the basement are small and confining. If you or your guest has a generous bottom, sit upstairs!
14124	79	2.0	1	2014-11-29	"The one extra star because the beer was good, the vibe was very friendly, and the other food looked good. Essentially, I did the classic ""what do you recommend?"" She recommended the goulash, which I didn't see on the menu. Alright, it sounded good. Turns out it was the chewy parts of meat in a too salty stew-like substance with a side of mushiness. Wasn't too pleasant. Also the only time I saw the waiter was when I ordered and... When I asked another waiter for the check. Turns out the ""goulash"" was $29 whereas most of the things on the menu looked to be around $10-20. You win waiter. You got me to spend $40. Here's your tip"
14125	79	1.0	1	2014-11-28	Horrible service. The waiters have limited knowledge of the menu, are avoiding you at all costs and are very rude in the manner they address you. Very disappointing. Limited menu offering is in my opinion OK, since the dishes were good. But again, the dishes are obscenely overpriced e.g., a cup of coffee is $7 and is not refilled. And its not good coffee. It is a shane really, the architecture is amazing and ambience could have been good otherwise...
14126	79	5.0	1	2014-11-27	Wow what a cute find! We went for lunch after the Guggenheim museum. We both had different sausage dishes of which the names were a bit difficult to remember. They were both delicious. We also had the dessert chocolate pistachio torte and the Apple strudel. I loved the strudel. It was chalk full of delicious apples and crispy on the outside. We washed it down with a chocolate and espresso drink. I also loved the view of the park from the window. The service was so attentive and friendly.
14127	79	4.0	1	2014-11-24	I do love coming here, it is true. I love the pastries most of all. I love looking at them along the wall and in the pastry case. And I love eating them. For most of my visits, I chose the hazelnut torte, but the last time I had it it was not hazelnut chocolaty enough, so yesterday I had the hazelnut chocolate mousse cake. I especially loved the hazelnut wafer cream on the bottom and the presentation, which made it look like a treasure chest. I also enjoyed trying my mother's sachertorte--outstanding! My Viennese hot chocolate had a delicate flavor. The smoked trout crepes were delicate and filling, despite their tiny size. I also liked the selection of excellent rye bread and butter that came with my mother's Hungarian goulash. The atmosphere is wonderful.
14128	79	4.0	1	2014-11-24	A wonderful atmosphere with a rustic and homey feel. The spatzle and wiener schnitzel dishes were both very tasty, but if you are going to go for lunch make sure you leave room for dessert which was the highlight of my meal.The mozarttorte was delicious and light and airy, accompany that with a milchkaffee and enjoy your surroundings. Cafe Sabarsky is a real treat.
14129	79	1.0	1	2014-11-23	"Nothing is more deceitful than the notion of an authentic Viennese coffee and hot chocolate (did I mention the ""hot chocolate"" was clearly not Viennese & was made with hot water & some sort of dried instant mix) so tawdry and cheap. Shame on you Neue Gallerie. The ambiance did little to excel in wonderment with a cheap chandelier and paper napkins, tepid hot chocolate and lastly (children cover your ears, ladies have your smelling salts at the ready)... An unpardonable presentation of the refreshments in... Plastic ""glasses"" with no handles. I deign to write this unfortunate experience and would not besmirch my lips to EVER refer anyone to this drab, overpriced, disappointment of a Viennese experience. Cheap cutlery, no table clothes, indifferent waiter, and paper Napkins to boot. Avoid this place. Refinement and ambiance are strangers. I found myself quite  préoccupé, and tried to carry myself away from this barbaric slaughterhouse in the guise of a Viennese cafe. And now my review is Fini"
14130	79	4.0	1	2014-10-22	Lovely quaint atmospheric cafe/restaurant hidden within the Neue Galerie Museum, and away from the crowds thronging the Metropolitan Museum a few streets down. Food was delicious and service prompt. We had the Pumpkin soup (a Fall special), Smoked Bratwurst stuffed with Cheddar Cheese, and Smoked Salmon with Cream Cheese (sandwich), for an appetizer and mains respectively. And rounding up with dessert - a Viennese coffee (you have to get the one topped with whipped cream, absolutely divine) and a Sarbaskytorte (choc and rum cake). Worth another visit!
14131	79	5.0	1	2014-10-19	The meals are awesome.  Great find doing our visit the NY. Sausage with cheddar,  goulash excellent!
14132	79	5.0	1	2014-09-13	This place is quite elegant as it is in the Neue Gallerie, my favourite museum in all new york as being the only place that you can see authentic german and austrian art and pieces from Nolde, Kandinsky, Klimt, Klee etc. And the cafe is quite refreshing and suitable after a nice tour in this exquisite collection. You should try the Mozarttorte if you like chocolate and a fan of pistachio, There are other stuff as well like Kirschtorte and Sachertorte but this one is actually something you can not find elsewhere in the city and an authentic example of what you will call the german sweet tooth. Also their Kaiser Melange is amazing with the added flavor of whipped cream and a perfect amount of tart coffee flavor. The food menu is also very nice, maybe not as quite advanced as Wallse but still. You might enjoy the pretzels, a perfect spatzle and some bratwurst to cite a few. Nice Job. - Again, Wallse and Blaue Gans are recommended if you are interested in german & austrian cuisine and actually know that there is more to that area than perfect beer and wurst.
14133	79	4.0	1	2014-09-06	This cafe is located inside the Neue Galerie. It has an interesting menu with a variety of Austrian and German baked goods, coffee drinks, alcoholic beverages, and entrees. Because of its location and decor, it has a classy vibe, and is one of the most fun places to enjoy a cup of coffee in New York City. While pricey, there are enough choices on the menu that one can enjoy the experience on any budget.
14134	79	3.0	1	2014-08-31	As an Austrian myself I wanted to go and taste a bit of home and went to this cafe to have an overpriced coffee. I was a bit disappointed by the atmosphere and service. The servers were minimally friendly and very cold. The cafe was missing some decoration details. The ceiling was bery plain as well as the chandeliers and side lamps. The cakes looked only ok and the prices were too high for the quality unfortunately. Though liked to feel a bit of home.
14135	79	5.0	1	2014-08-28	I am dazzled by the crepe soufflé + peach compote dessert. The crepe soufflé bites were as fluffy as they were light as they were perfectly delectable. The addition of the roasted peach compote was  more heavenly than any dessert I have ever tasted. All of my five stars go to this dessert. The ambiance, staff, and dining experience were great but nothing compares to this delectable treat.
14136	79	5.0	1	2014-08-25	Beatifully decorated, welcoming Wiener Café in the heart of upper east side where you can always come to read a newspaper
14137	79	2.0	1	2014-08-19	One star for desserts. My strudel was undercooked - pieces of raw dough inside. My daughter's cake was so hard and stale she had to stab it with a fork to break it into pieces. I added a star for the view and the building. Check out Klimt upstairs and go elsewhere for lunch.
14138	79	1.0	1	2014-08-11	Food was delicious
14139	79	4.0	1	2014-08-08	Wonderful setting - settled into the Central Park facing side of the mansion home to the Neue Gallerie.  Wonderfully European feel and great to get a booth with lots of natural light.  Staff look and behave Austrian in the sense of crispness of attire and efficiency of attitude. Menu is wide ranging and true to the culture.  My favorites include the Paprika Wurst Salat, deviled eggs, smoked bratwurst.  Breakfast also delights.  Of course some come for the desserts / tortes.  Great place to splurge with tourist friends spending the day in the park.  The actual museum is wonderful but second tier to the big classics.
14140	79	4.0	1	2014-08-07	I heard that the Apple Strudel was to die for so I bookmarked it because my bf likes apple desserts...I don't at all. But, I liked this one :) We came here after the Guggenheim, which has a really interesting Italian Futurist exhibit at the moment. We were waiting for a Restaurant Week reservation and didn't want to eat anything heavy and ruin our dinner. Coming to Cafe Sabarsky was perfect. We got 2 different teas. They come in these tea pots & one would have been enough to share, but we have different tastes. I liked the Fruity Tea and he liked the Oolong. I think I had 4 cups myself! haha The Apple Studel was delicious. I liked the fluffy whipped cream and the way that the apple was sliced really thin. The dessert was light and exactly what we needed. You can peruse around the border of the cafe and check out the other desserts too, which I refrained from doing because I have too much of a sweet tooth. Speaking of which, I would like to come back and try the hot chocolate when it gets colder! mmmm After enjoying the antique ambiance and our apple studel, we took a walk in Central Park. It was a delightful afternoon!
14141	79	2.0	1	2014-08-02	"I've eaten here several times during my life in NYC - two nights ago being my 6th.  Last time I had been was a couple of years ago.  My uncle's favorite lunch spot in NYC, I had taken him here for his birthday.  Everything over the years was consistently good - the service impeccable and the food top notch like most of the reviews on here reveal, but two nights ago I couldn't help wonder if this was another one of those ""used to be good"" places that has fallen way down hill. The good - the place is still gorgeous and sexy.  You will feel transported to a classy spot in Europe where the servers are happy to just get you what you want and leave you alone for the rest of the night while you bask in the decor, people watch and smoke cigarettes.  Okay, I got carried away - no cigarettes in Cafe Sabarsky obviously, but you get the idea.  It has a sort of elegant soft silence about it too - it's a very pleasant place to eat. The bad - the food wasn't BAD per se, but it wasn't as good as I remembered, and therefore when we got the bill we felt absolutely duped.  There were four of us, and we had decided to share a bunch of plates.   We started with the Hungarian goulash which was delicious, but there were several chewy pieces of beef in there.   The spaetzle that came with it was a little too creamy for my tastes, and I had remembered more ""stuff"" being in it before - veggies, mushrooms, etc.   The beet salad was superb - definitely my favorite.  Something so simple and so well done - this made me look forward to our main dishes to come.   For mains we got the Bavarian sausage with warm pretzel and mustard, and the Bratwurst with riesling sauerkraut and roasted potatoes.  We also got a dish of spaetzel at my recommendation but I was a little worried after sampling it with the goulash during the appetizers.   The Bavarian sausage was great, but the pretzel tasted stale and was not exactly warm.  I honestly would have preferred a pretzel off the street from a dirty water dog cart. The Bratwurst was less good but still acceptable.  It just tasted a bit mushy compared to the Bavarian sausage, and the sauerkraut was also mushy with no hint of riesling to be had.  The roasted potatoes in this dish are god awful.  They remind me of the cheap ones you might get in a Holiday Inn buffet breakfast bar.  The Spaetzle was just wrong.  It tasted like a bowl of cream with noodles.  It needed salt and the veggies came from the freezer (with the exception of maybe the mushrooms).  I was embarrassed for having gone on and on about their spaetzle. Regardless, we were four friends eating in a cool spot, enjoying our beers and each other's company, so we opted for desserts to finish the whole thing off. The apple strudel tasted fine, but the texture was off - everything was soft and sort of limp.  The cheese cake was pretty good, actually - it''s made of quark cheese which is a lighter sort of yogurt cheese.  It's not your typical heavy and thick cheese cake.  The linzertorte I was not a fan of.  It tasted dry and a little stale with the exception of the jam on the top.  Worst of all, the ""fresh"" whipped cream that came with all the desserts tasted funny.  It wasn't exactly sour, but it didn't taste fresh at all, kind of stale as if it had been sitting around for a while. the ugly - the service was AWFUL.  I sat down to meet two of my friends before my husband joined us and the server came to deliver their drinks and just sped off without even acknowledging me or asking me if I wanted one.... I ended up having to flag him down.  He ended up bringing me the WRONG beer - how he got that wrong I have no idea.  He seemed a bit rushed, coming by to clear our plates the minute they looked mostly empty.  Twice he came by as we were still eating.  Keep in mind we were one of THREE tables there.  They were far from busy.  He seemed very nervous and lacking in confidence.  He  had the personality of a wet blanket.  We joked with him a couple of times about how our friend is old and needs decaf, and he said with no expression on his face ""so one regular and one decaf?""  He was just a real downer about the whole experience. Bottom line, I think I'm over Cafe Sabarsky.  It reminded me of Tavern on the Green or even the Plaza's Palm Court where these placed became popular and the quality just went downhill while the prices went up.  It's somewhat of a tourist trap if you ask me, and I don't think I'll be returning.   Auf wiedersehen Cafe Sabarsky."
14142	79	5.0	1	2014-08-01	This is one if my favorite cafes in the city. I make it my routine to stop by here with a book for a nice meal whenever I visit Manhattan. In a city full of very tiny spaces, most of which are partly below ground level, Cafe Sabarsky really stands out. With its super high ceilings and very tall windows thus is one cafe where you can actually eat at a table by the window. The ambience is extremely pleasant.   There is often a long wait during peak hours.  But just before or after the rush, I've never waited more than five minutes.   The food is delicious as well and the portions are just right where you can tickle your palette without falling into a food coma. Amazing desserts as well.
14143	79	4.0	1	2014-07-16	The sausage is awesome with the strawberry layered cake  as the end ;) highly recommended
14144	79	5.0	1	2014-07-12	This is like going to a restaurant and your  building cirta 1914   15 foot ceilings wraparound wood rooms  beautiful architecture marble tables menu is of European German style foods excellent
14145	79	4.0	1	2014-07-07	Having spent some time in Vienna, this cafe has an Old World feel. It's great place to enjoy high tea. My wife and I shared a tasty apple strudel with a dollop of fresh whipped cream ( mit schlag). Service was quick and attentive for late afternoon. The cafe is open to the public even though it is located on the ground floor of the Neue Gallerie.
14146	79	5.0	1	2014-07-06	Definitely a five star place to visit. My friend and I came here for a short afternoon tea after a long visit to Metropolitan, and so wish to get something not too creamy yet able to feed us well. I was a bit starving hence got the bavarian sausage and she got the Mozartorte with nuts inside. Love them!
14147	79	5.0	1	2014-07-01	I've been here 3 times after visiting the museum. Albeit a little pricey, the ambiance and the food makes up for it. Authentic to the core and a wide variety...this place is delicious and quick!
14148	79	5.0	1	2014-06-20	Such a delightful place to dine. A hidden gem, the dining room itself is stoic in natural prewar grandeur. The food is perfect. First course: Beet Salad is the best in the city. We each had our own as too good to share. Dinner: We had the spaetzle.. Which was light and flavorful with a hint of nutmeg and amazing creamed wild mushroom, carrot, peas and tarragon. The Wiener schnitzel was light crisp not greasy and delicate flavor served with a lingonberry sauce.. Cucumbers & Potatoes. Dessert: Chocolate Rum Cake ~ seriously perfect. Apple Strudel ~ which was better than any I've had in Germany. Layered Strawberry Elderflower Mousse Cake ~ serious Heaven and the perfect atmosphere made for most memorable evening.
14149	79	5.0	1	2014-06-07	If you enjoy Austrian food, check out this spot!! Delicious spaetzle dishes and amazing deserts. The service was top notch as well. For a NYC restaurant, prices were reasonable.
14150	79	4.0	1	2014-06-01	We got the last item on the dessert menu (don't remember what it's called) but it's basically pieces of this doughy thing with caramelized apples on the side. It felt like eating little donut pieces, it was SO GOOD. We also got the double espresso with whipped cream, which was nothing special. It did give me that kick that I needed though.
14151	79	3.0	1	2014-05-28	While the food is amazing, the service is really horrible. My family and I were seated basically on top of a vent and it was really cold. We knew it was busy so we thought we would stick it out, but after we put in our order, we saw about 4 or 5 free tables and no one waiting for them outside. We asked the hostess if she would move us, she thought it would be okay but when she asked our waiter, he said no since it would be too much of a hassle to change our order to a new table. They did turn down the AC, but it only helped until it kicked back on. In general, our waiter was horrible. He barely came over to us. We waited over 20 minutes for him to come back to take our dessert order after we finished our main course. I might chose something a little less expensive and with better service next time.
14152	79	4.0	1	2014-05-25	After an amazing exhibit, one visits the cafe. Small! Extremely crowded. The food was diverse and amazing. I like the fact that the food coincided with the exhibit. Enjoyable atmosphere despite it being quite crowded. Expensive! Be forewarned!
14153	79	5.0	1	2014-05-14	I just spent $97 on a lunch with my friend. $97.. *_* Some of my friends think I'm outta my mind. Well.. guess what?? I don't give a FCUK! This place was that damn good. Some suitable hash tags would be: #foodporn #dessertporn #fatpplproblems #NoFcuksGiven Located right across the street from Central Park, tucked away inside a museum, this is a nice little gem. Has a rustic, old fashioned, and cozy feel to it, with warm wood walls, dim lighting and a grand piano in a corner of the room, Cafe Sabarsky could be an excellent date place or perhaps a business lunch even. My friend got back from Syracuse University recently and I wanted to take her somewhere that she'll probably never forget, and Cafe Sabarsky didn't disappoint. The dining experience was awesome..the food was amazing. Like fatasses, we each got a chilled iced drink for starters, with house-made whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I had a chilled iced coffee and she had a chilled, house-made chocolate milk. Both were pretty damn good, and yes, before ya'll start judging, we did have dessert for apps. #NoFcuksGiven Next, I had a piece of delicious, moist, perfectly cooked and seasoned Atlantic Salmon cooked medium, while she had a Roasted Bratwurst, riesling sauerkraut and roasted potatoes and dijon mustard. That sausage was surprisingly good. Perfectly seasoned, and cooked to perfection. My first time having German sausage and it was an awesome experience. For dessert, I had a slice of Pistachio, Nougat Chocolate Cake and she had a Quark Cheesecake w/ Raspberry Meringue. No words. I'm done. No words can describe the sensation that was coursing through my taste buds.. loll :D
14154	79	4.0	1	2014-05-05	Part of the German and Austrian (?) museum, we came because it's between the Guggenheim and MET, and we wanted to grab a bite. Don't wait in the museum line, as there is a separate line for the cafe. Also, if you don't are to eat in the finer ambience of the polished woodwork of the main floor cafe, with it's stunning views, you can skip the line and instead eat downstairs in the other cafe that has the exact same food (with a much shorter - or nonexistent - line) Great German sausages, good sides and fabulous coffee. They make Viennese hot chocolate, but if you ask for a mocha (which is not on the menu) they will make that with shots of coffee; it was delicious. There is a partial view of central park across the street, so excellent as a tourist. If you don't care about the view and just want the eats, head downstairs for a shorter wait. The staff told me the food was identical, but we waited for the nice room.
14155	79	3.0	1	2014-05-04	A very old-fashion and European-style cafe located in the Neue Galerie, right outside of the Central Park. High ceiling, big window/mirror, marble tables, and vintage chairs; sitting in this small cafe, you will just feel that you are traveling in Europe. We came here for afternoon tea and dessert, but we were all attracted by the savory menu as well. I am usually not a big fan of sausage, but their traditional bratwurst accompanied by sauerkraut, potatoes and Dijon was way better than what I expected. The ground meat was well seasoned and cooked just right, juicy but not feel fatty. The sauerkraut reminded me the very famous sour cabbage stew with sliced pork belly in the northeastern of China. Beet salad was alright; I wish the goat cheese could be chopped and mixed in the salad. We had Pistachio Chocolate cake and Berry Cheese Cake as desserts. The cheese cake was very light and fruity due to the berries and the meringue, which completely beats any kinds of dense New York cheese cake in my heart. Pistachio Chocolate Cake came out with various layers, drizzled with pistachios at the sided bottom, creamy but not heavy. Small nougat were mixed with the mousse layer, but I wish more nougat! Overall was good but a little bit pricy experience. I will definitely come back and try other desserts on the menu.
14156	79	5.0	1	2014-05-03	Ritzy Austrian food, and undoubtedly one of the highlights of my year. Potato Dumpling filled with Smoked Pork served on Sauerkraut is handcrafted, juicy and spicy, and every morsel crumbly yet refined. Goulash soup is dark and peppery. They have veal wiener Schnitzel, Smoked Trout Crepe, too. They don't do ordinary, predictable food here at this fine dining, French hardwood and brass establishment (within a German-Austrian art museum facility). Extraordinary is the high-end word to aptly use here, especially when it comes to dessert cakes, coffees, and hot chocolate - even that is whipped up fancy. My favorite confection: The Mozarttorte, a pistachio and nougat stuffed chocolate cake. #classiceats
14157	79	3.0	1	2014-04-20	Cafe Sabarsky is located in quite a ritzy area in Manhattan. There is usually a 30 minute wait for a table, and you have to go through security, which is quite annoying. However, the cafe is a cute little gem across from Central Park, and has a different German/Austrian theme. I had the edelberry syrup with sparkling water, which was refreshing and unique tasting, and a delicious soft pretzel with lots of mustard. My friend got the bratwurst with sourkraut and potatoes, and that was good as well. I also had the hazelnut tart with berries, even though it was hard to choose because they had an entire page of desserts. It was good, even though I must say I've had way better tarts in my lifetime. The downsides are that their menu is a tad bit on the pricey side, and doesn't offer a huge variety of food- mostly just sandwiches and sausages. My tart was $9, and the bratwurst was like $18- but it's understandable given the location. I recommend going to Francois Payard, Bouchon bakery, Lauderee, or Maison Kayser for better desserts. Some of the wait staff were also pretty unfriendly and unhelpful. However, I still enjoyed my experience there and might go back in the future.
14158	79	4.0	1	2014-04-18	Grab a nice Viennese lunch and enjoy the Neue Gallery
14159	79	4.0	1	2014-04-12	If you are willing to wait for 30 mins outside just to get inside then another 15 minutes to be seated, then you are in for a great treat.  We didn't have much expectation except that it is conveniently located across the Metropolitan Museum of Arts. But their menu while limited and maybe a bit pricy, it's all worth it. I have the sausage with sauerkraut and Dijon. I must say it was delicious. Their spicy egg with paprika is also excellent. But their desserts are the real surprise.  The Vienna Dark chocolate cake and apple strudel were out of this world.
14160	79	5.0	1	2014-04-06	Beautiful atmosphere, like a graceful vintage film set--large mirrors, marble fireplace, lavish floral arrangements, wooden paneling, gentle lighting. Classic cafe chairs. Great place to go for a let's-taste-all-the-cakes birthday gathering. Makes you want to put all your finest coat tails and furs to eat in style. The cakes are presented beautifully and würste plates are delicious as well. Lovely experience.
5097	79	4.0	1	2014-03-29	This was our second visit to Cafe Sabarsky at Neue Galerie.  Last time we just had tea and dessert, but this time we opted for their lunch menu.   Obviously, the location is great - just outside of Central Park and only a few blocks from the 86th & Lexington subway station.  We wanted to see the Neue Galerie, but the line for that was pretty long.  Instead, we waited in the shorter line for the cafe, and by the time we had eaten we were able to skip the line for the gallery and buy our tickets inside. I love the setting - it reminds you of being in Europe.  High ceilings, marble tables, mirrors and large vases filled with flowering branches.  It's definitely a treat since their prices are steep, but it's worth it once in a while.   As could be expected for a German/Austrian museum, the food was a variety of traditional and more modern German and Austrian food.  Think schnitzel, goulash and viennese pastries.  Everything is great quality.   They carry Harney & Sons teas, which are always really flavorful and remind me of the tea I used to drink in Europe.  We ordered a pot of their Orange Passion Fruit Tea tea (which is a mix of rosehip, hibiscus and dried oranges).  It was fruity and full-bodied, as most Harney & Sons teas are.  They give you a nice big teapot so you can get 3-4 cups out of it.  We also had the Gluhwein (hot spiced red wine with orange and cloves) since the weather was rainy and cold.  It was a nice way to warm up while we waited for our meal. Roasted Bratwurst with Riesling Sauerkraut, Roasted Potatoes and Dijon.  You could tell the chef was a pro at bavarian food.  The bratwurst was cooked just right, the potatoes were flavorful and complimented the warm sauerkraut, while the dijon added just the right kick to what could have otherwise been a blander dish.   We also ordered a really nice sandwich - the Matjes Herring on Egg Spread with apple slices.  It came with a lovely little garden salad with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, radishes and a light lemon-mayonnaise dressing.  The sandwiches were presented face-open and were a classier version of tuna-salad, as the herring is saltier and carries more of a kick than tuna.  The apple slices and onions on top were a nice combination to give the sandwich a little crispy texture.  It was served on a European style whole wheat bread (dense bread that is thinly sliced).  Perfect for a lover of all things European! Finally, the ladies sitting next to us ordered this pistachio chocolate cake that made us drool.  They told us they had seen the people at our table order it before them and they simply had to try it.  They gave it rave reviews, so we decided we couldn't miss out.  And I'm glad we didn't.  It was called the Mozarttorte - chocolate cake with pistachio and nougat layers.  SO good!  It wasn't as rich as some Austrian/German tortes - the cake was creamy but not heavy, and the pistachio/nougat layers were not overpowerly rich.  A really nice way to end an excellent meal.  If you're on the Upper East side and want a relaxed atmosphere (and have some money to spare), I highly recommend Cafe Sabarsky.  However, if you're on a budget, skip the lines and find somewhere cheaper.  If it weren't inside a museum I would definitely consider it overpriced.
14161	79	5.0	1	2014-03-24	Lovely quiet atmosphere, gorgeous wood paneling and marble decor. We ordered cafes and a gold-leafed chocolate mousse cake that was divine. Not cheap, but worth your time after looking through Neue Gallery and the Metropolitan Museum.
14162	79	4.0	1	2014-03-13	Had drinks, dinner and desert last Friday, and it was a pleasurable experience! My husband and I had the Brezen & Händelmaier's, Lachsfilet mit Mais und Zucchini, German beers and mozarttorte. All were delicious. Servers were nice. Will definitely come back.
14163	79	3.0	1	2014-03-08	"Lovely setting - you feel like you are In a Viennese cafe. Long wait to get in, however, and ultimately disappointing food.  Our server did not give knowledgeable guidance to the dessert menu. We ordered a chocolate rum cake that was so mediocre we didn't finish it and a chocolate hazelnut cake that was excellent. At $9.00/slice, they have no business serving a cake that isn't fabulous. When the server asked how things were, and we said the rum cake wasn't very good, he said ""sorry,"" smiled, and ran away without offering to get us something else.Viennese coffee was not hot, and not very good. At $5.00/tiny cup, it should be much better. So, the 3 stars are for atmosphere and the chocolate hazelnut cake. I don't think I would eat there again."
8474	79	5.0	1	2014-03-05	A wonderful slice of Austria/Germany in a Carrère & Hastings gem on the UES with Central Park views.  Did I miss anything? Oh yes, the mansion/museum  was renovated by Annabelle Selldorf and the food.... the food.  The food is top notch.. what else can I say that hasn't already been said about the place? You really can't go wrong. I often crave the spätzle and sumptuous desserts (don't make me choose). Sure, the prices are on the higher end... but far from unreasonable... the fine quality of literally everything down to the napkins is there.  Also, to anyone whining about the wait, go downstairs...  that's what I do if I'm alone or in a rush. Same menu... same place... different -more relaxed- decor. If you're trying to impress someone, dine upstairs.  To me, this place is the epitome of NYC embracing and highlighting other cultures.
14164	79	5.0	1	2014-02-24	Summary: I don't usually give out five stars, but when I do, I prefer Cafe Sabarsky We expected a good meal, but were totally caught off guard by how outstanding everything was. We started with the beet salad which paired perfectly with the goat cheese accompaniment. Next we had the schnitzel which was amazingly tender and amazing with the lingonberry sauce, and the Bavarian sausage which was light and delicious. Oh and let's not forget the pretzel, so incredibly soft yet crunchy on the outside. Lastly the Einspaenner coffee, a Viennese specially of espresso topped with their amazing homemade whipped cream, was an incredible finish.
14165	79	5.0	1	2014-02-19	As I expected, the tarragon spätzle with wild mushrooms and peas was creamy and delicately hearty, accompanied by a toasty glass of gluhvein. We also got a cheddar stuffed sausage on yummy Riesling sauerkraut and a slice of rich sachertorte and a slice of chestnut cake, but there were so many more desserts I want to go back and try! We saw a lucky little girl being treated by her daddies to a very ladylike slice of cake, and it made me happy to think this is a nice place for grownups and classy children to enjoy an afternoon in a cozy turn-of-the-century, dark wood paneled dining room.
14166	79	2.0	1	2014-02-15	I visited Cafe Sarbasky with two of my friends in possibly the stormiest day of the winter. The snow was falling horizontally and attacking my face for most of the day, so we weren't the happiest of people. When we entered the gallery we were greeted by two security guards- one friendly and normal, and the other a complete creep. The creep seemed rather perturbed by the snow on my coat and later, in typical creepy fashion  followed us to the restroom, which is just so rude. Like what am I going to do, steal your toilet paper in the heist of the century? This was pretty annoying, and put me off this whole place. The desserts were overpriced and alright, but this is New York and you can find way better. I am giving it two stars only because it was really close to Central Park, and was a good place to take shelter when I needed it, but apart from that I don't think I will ever visit again. PS- Sarbasky management if you read this, I do not have his name, but please ask your security guard to be courteous of your patrons. He should also not wait for women outside of restrooms because that is very very weird.
14167	79	4.0	1	2014-02-15	Cafe Sabarsky was on my go to list for a whole thanks to its good Yelp reviews. And I can see why it's a local favorite. Aside from the gorgeous interior and location in the Neue Galerie, the food, especially the desserts, are a dream. The bratwurst was juicy and delicious. Be careful of the mustard - it went straight to my nose! But still strangely enjoyable... The cakes! The cakes! It's every girl's dream to be honest. I had the chocolate hazelnuts cake (forgot the actual name) and it was superb. Not too sweet, dense and just generally delicious. My only problems with this place are: the long lineup, and the high prices. I'm not too sure why the prices were so high - it was high even for NYC standards in my opinion.  Would I come here often? Probably only as a special treat, but there are a lot of other places I can treat myself better, and for less money!
14168	79	4.0	1	2014-02-02	Lovely room with old world charm. Vienna style coffee and menu offerings are a pleasant break from the average coffee house. Pleasant and attentive staff works hard to keep things humming along. Very popular with young families with very well behaved children. We even picked up the check for a young mom since we were so impressed with the manners of her 2 sons. It can get very noisy when the baristas are banging things around and the kiddies are clambering about, but it's a happy racket and it settles down pretty fast. Bonus points for being such a great jumping off point for a visit to the Gallery. A previous reviewer mentioned a ventilation problem near the windows. We had no issues so it may have been fixed.  The windows are great for people watching.

It's decor and charm mimic that of many Viennese cafés, offering up classic fare like wiener schnitzel and sachertorte.  Cafe Sabarsky's rendition is pretty good, but my recommendation is the apple strudel with whipped cream and coffee.
14170	79	2.0	1	2014-01-20	During a stay in New York in December, I was looking forward to a meal at Café Sabarsky after several New York friends had recommended it. But unfortunately, the  breakfast I had there turned out to be a big disappointment and put a damper on the start of our first day of holiday vacation. Food was not prepared properly (for example, the eggs were not cooked as described on the menu) and some things did not come out at all (we were told they were out of some things that were listed on the menu--but told this after our food arrived and we inquired about it). It took about 30 minutes for us to get coffee after we ordered, despite the fact that the café was not that crowded; when it did arrive, it was underwhelming, a big surprise for a Viennese cafe.   As others mentioned, the service was also problematic. We had a hard time getting help when we needed it and some of the servers didn't communicate very well. That's forgivable, but what's not is the sarcastic attitude of one female server when we inquired about a food item that did not come out of the kitchen. The café itself is gorgeous and the Neue Galerie itself is worth a visit. For the menu prices, however, Café Sabarsky can do better and my experience there does make me inclined to visit Gutenbrunner's other restaurants.
14171	79	4.0	1	2014-01-17	Very often I stop here after an outing at the Met. Be it for just coffee and cake or a full Austrian meal, both the place and the foot are delicious. You absolutely must try the saker torte of the strudels, and if you are going to earth their schnitzel it's got to be with one of their selections of beers. Not inexpensive, but definitely worth for a special treat.
14172	79	4.0	1	2014-01-17	Food is good. The Kaiser pancake is what I came for after having had it in Vienna.  This version is smaller and caramelized - so it's much sweeter.  Price is average for NYC with a good ambience. Just don't sit by the window with the vent blowing cold air in the winter.  Since they couldn't do anything about the cold air which they admitted people have complained, I draped my coat over to redirect the cold air.  But my feet were getting cold. I know better next time where to sit.
14173	79	4.0	1	2014-01-12	One of our friends likes to frequent this place. We decided to meet there another couple for brunch on Sunday afternoon. The line to get in was about 15-20 minutes but it was well worth it. The sausages are great and the desserts are also quite unique. Well worth a visit!
14174	79	4.0	1	2014-01-03	Cute cafe that's in the same building as a museum.  We didn't go to the museum but stopped by for a quick dinner.  I don't personally like German food but the cheddar cheese- stuffed sausage and potatoes I had was good.  Great ambiance.  Wait staff could have been more attentive but service overall was good.
14175	79	2.0	1	2013-12-20	I was so disappointed by this place from the very beginning. The hostess was very rude when we arrived. There were tables available but she ignored us for about 10 minutes even though she saw us waiting and kept looking at us and then walking away. I politely went up to her and asked if we needed a reservation and she said they don't take reservations for lunch but that it would be a 45 minute wait. We waited 30 minutes and she finally took us to a table and I watched the whole time and the same tables that were available when we arrived were still empty when she seated us. I have to be honest I never saw such a rude hostess in my restaurant experience, and I have come across some unprofessional ones. Anyway when we were finally seated out server wasn't as bad as the hostess, however I wasn't impressed with the food. I have been to Vienna many times and the food at this place doesn't come close. The Wiener Schnitzel that I had was average at best. I tasted my fiancee's Goulash Soup and I didn't think that was so great either. The dessert was nothing to brag about. I had the Apple Strudel and I didn't enjoy it at all. I didn't enjoy my experience here at all and I would never recommend it. It is very overpriced and I felt uncomfortable the whole time I was there. I really think for some reason they didn't want to serve us and she thought that by making us wait we would leave, we should have.
14176	79	4.0	1	2013-11-30	Five stars for the Feuilletine alone. Everything else was pretty good too, including the Bratwurst. I had ordered the smoked one stuffed with cheese and received instead the roasted one without cheese. Just as well. Great sauerkraut without the usual cloves and spices. Loved the mustard. Nice potatoes that tasted like my mother's.  Beautiful restaurant visually.
14177	79	5.0	1	2013-11-27	We tried this Viennese-style cafe for both breakfast and lunch on a recent trip to New York.  It's expensive, but delicious.  The coffee drinks and the desserts are fantastic, and I especially enjoyed some of the traditional German/Austrian food on the menu for lunch. I stuck to the wursts and sauerkraut, which were excellent, but many of the other dishes looked good as well.  And since the desserts are so good, I recommend eating one with lunch and getting a slice of the delicious fruit kuchen to go!
9611	79	5.0	1	2013-11-24	Awesome Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut & Rösterdäpfel.  The mustard is radical!
14178	79	2.0	1	2013-11-06	"Came here based on top reviews and pictures of the dessert.... and my cake craving. However, Cafe Sabarsky is definitely overrated. This is located in Neue Galerie museum on the first floor. I ordered the bavarian sausage (2 boiled sausages and a pretzel $16) with pretzel and sachertorte cake ($9). When I sat down I asked for a glass of hot water... who would of known they charged $1 for this! Aside from being pricey, the service was pretty rushed. Other reviews mentioned this too... not sure why the servers were so pushy. I sat down and immediately the server came and asked what I wanted to order... Dang can I at least look at the menu first? Then before even finishing dessert the bill was brought to my table as if to mention.. ""Now it's time for you to leave."" As for the food, the sausage was bland, luckily the pretzel was good. The dessert was not impressive especially for $9! It's suppose to have apricot confiture but there was no taste of that at all. In fact it was really bland. If you want to try good German food I rather recommend going to a Biergarten."
14179	79	1.0	1	2013-11-04	"The worst service in New York and the antithesis of the type of service you receive in Vienna. We went in on a Monday afternoon for a birthday lunch. We couldn't believe the maltreatment we received by the waitstaff. First, we were rushed to order our food, when we clearly stated that we needed time to look at the menu.  During our meal, we were asked if we were finished even though we had half of our food, and it was obvious that we were still eating. Three different wait staff members attempted to remove our plates when we already told them that we were not finished. The third time, our server, stated he just wanted to give us dessert menus - basically rushing us. He was extremely condescending and haughty. In the middle of our dessert, he wanted to take the plate away, again with no indication that we were finished. To end this ""spectacular"" service, our check was tossed to our table. As someone who is in the restaurant business, I always tip my server - however in this special case, I regret leaving a dime. While the food is good, the service really ruined it for us, and we will not return or recommend this establishment to anyone."
14180	79	3.0	1	2013-10-28	Feels very much like Europe. It has that old world feel to it. A bit stuffy, definitely pricey. Did breakfast. A cup of coffee $6 - no refills!
14181	79	4.0	1	2013-10-26	Cute little cafe in the Gallerie.  Very expensive, no coffee refills, but the food is great and staff are very attentive.  Perfect place for an early breakfast.
14182	79	3.0	1	2013-10-24	This place has a rather retro-feel, a little austere in atmosphere. I was not thrilled by the food--one salad consisted mostly of half an avocado, and I ended up eating three entrees to be full. Drinks are refreshing, however. I believe this would be a nice place to get an afternoon cup of tea or fizzy drink after a tiresome wander around in the met museum.
14183	79	2.0	1	2013-10-22	I can't believe all the 5 star reviews this place has. I was so excited to try this place out after the great experience I had in the museum and I  was so disappointed with the treatment I received. I  came here on a Friday afternoon a few months ago and right from the start I knew this place was horrible. The girl at the door was completely condescending. She told us we had to wait and I had no problem with that. There was no place to sit and wait because a few people were sitting already so we stood outside the door to wait and she came up to us with a smirk and told us that we would have to leave because we couldn't stand there for security reasons. I never in my life heard something so ridiculous.  We were humiliated and we decided to leave. I was in the neighborhood a few weeks ago and decided to try again. I must have been crazy. This time someone different was at the door and they were much nicer and we waited outside the entrance until there was a table (nobody told us this time we needed to step away from the door.) The food was so so. I wasn't thrilled with the dessert and I expected better. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because the Goulash Soup was average.  I will never recommend this place or come here again. I find it hard to believe so many people had such a great experience at this snobfest.
14184	79	5.0	1	2013-10-09	Five years later, my 2008 review still stands.  This is a great spot. We went for breakfast, which they serve from 9-11.  At 9:05 we were the third table occupied.  No wait, good service, and such a delightful setting.  The room alone is worth the visit, classy with high ceilings and beautiful woodwork.   The list of coffee alternatives alone is worth the visit.  Add the Viennese pastries and good eggs, and it is fantastic.
14185	79	5.0	1	2013-10-07	I love this little cafe - a bit expensive, but the ambience is so quaint, the food was good quality, delicious, and beautifully plated. And the service was excellent. Also, the desserts!!! Try the pistachio nougat chocolate cake (the Mozarttorte). I'm definitely coming back to try all the desserts. A great place to bring guests from out of town or to have a nice lunch with girlfriends. And old people watch.
14186	79	5.0	1	2013-09-18	This place is very European. The decor, the food, the atmosphere all reminds me of Europe and its beauties. It's location inside a German/Austrian gallery helps too. Food-wise, very solid. Like many other reviewers said, the apple strundel is super awesome. I got the Bavarian Sausage for entree and loved it. They have a grapefruit beer (Schöfferhofer Grapefruit) on the menu and that was a very good brunch/lunch drink as well.
14187	79	4.0	1	2013-09-10	I had lunch with a friend on Monday. It was very charming. We had open- faced sandwiches ( ham & smoked salmon)-two women empty plates- can't do much better. For dessert we shared apricot crepes. Make sure to save room. The only complaint is that they charge for coffee refills. I didn't like that.
11581	79	5.0	1	2013-08-29	An absolute gem. This cafe is actually inside the Neue Galerie (make a right as soon as you enter the gallery, then a left and the entrance will be on your right), which couldn't be more appropriate. It's a little taste of Vienna in New York. We had the Sachertorte (classic Viennese dark chocolate cake with house made apricot confiture) and the Linzertorte (hazelnut tart with fresh raspberry confiture) - both of which were outstanding.
14188	79	4.0	1	2013-08-20	Yummy and nice cafe within the Neue Gallerie. Had the streudel. Yum. :)
14189	79	4.0	1	2013-08-07	We really enjoy the cake and sausage!
14190	79	5.0	1	2013-08-01	I love this place - my trip to the museum is not complete until I've dropped by here. It's a charming decor, very traditional. Staff is friendly and professional. Menu is superb, everything I've had there has been extremely tasteful. Looking forward to my next museum visit already!
14191	79	5.0	1	2013-07-27	Every time I come here I am in Europe. It all transforms me there - the decor, the cake display,  menu, each bite of my food, your staff, your attitude, views from the window, the wooden walls, people around me, the real whipped cream... hmmm, poppy seed round cake... When I am homesick I come here and you soothe me and tell me it all will be ok. Thank you Danke Grezie Dekuju Merci
14192	79	2.0	1	2013-07-19	Great atmosphere, great coffee, great service, pathetic portions, ridiculous prices.   $62 for two cups of coffee a scrawny salad and a kids portion of Wiener Schnitzel with a spoonful of potato salad.   Ridiculous.   No, I would not do this again.   In Austria this meal would have been about the cheapest food on the menu.
11655	79	5.0	1	2013-06-26	I am obsessed with Cafe Sabarsky. The only drawback is the price (averages about $9 for a slice of cake. Delicious cake, but expensive nonetheless). The cafe is hidden inside Neue Galerie, with gold lettering announcing the name of the restaurant on the wall. Every time I've been here, I've had to wait in line just to enter the restaurant (New York has this thing about waiting in line for everything), but that is an indication of how good this place is. The interior is decorated beautifully. Like an old-time cafe in Berlin. I've only ever had dessert here, but it's been delicious each time. The Sachertorte (Viennese dark chocolate cake with house-made orange confiture) is amazing, as is the Topfencremetorte Mit Beeren Und Baiser (quark cheese cake with berries and meringue). Their drinks are delicious, though equally expensive. I've had the house-made Austrian hot chocolate (topped with dollops of whipped cream) and the hot spiced wine. Perfect for a post-Met dessert trip in the winter.
14193	79	1.0	1	2013-06-18	Cafe Sabarsky inspired me to write this joke: 3 people walk into an UES cafe - 2 doctors and a financier, all ready and able to spend their hard earned money on a good meal. Each of normal physical size and therefore requiring an average amount of food to feel satiated. An hour later, the same three walk out, each having spent more than $100 on essentially nothing. The punchline: Where did they go from Cafe Sabarsky? McDonald's!!! Because they were all still hungry!! Ha ha ha. Actually, it wasn't very funny at the time and that's exactly what happened when we tried this ridiculous little cafe. To start, everything on the menu is totally expensive. Okay, we get it - we're familiar with the UES...par for the course. The problem w/ Cafe Sabarsky is that each menu item is smaller than the next. Seriously, if I'm going to spend $25 on an app. could it please be more than one bite? I don't get this place at all. It looks harmless...unassuming little cafe tucked into a busy section of the museum district. We weren't prepared for the type of dining experience they're serving up (i.e. the type in which you must spend $500 before you're actually full). I've certainly dined in that fashion before (Moto, etc.) but at least I knew what I was getting myself into, in advance, each time. Cafe Sabarsky took us unawares and it will not happen again. I can't recommend this place unless you're looking for really, really small amounts of decent tasting food at really high prices. Oh, and the service was lackluster as well, but, don't forget to tip heavily for it.
14194	79	4.0	1	2013-05-25	Since Lady M Cake Boutique's waiter service was quite shitty, me and my friend decided to go somewhere. Thanks to Yelp for helping me find Cafe Sabarsky. There was a bit of waiting time but it was definitely worth every minute. The hostess seated us in front of the fireplace (not sure if its real). My friend ordered Rhubarb Mousse Tart (can't find the actual name on the website) with Milchkaffee (Café Latte) and I got the Kaiserschmarren Mit Rhabarber - Erdbeerkompot (shredded, caramelized crêpes soufflé with rhubarb - strawberry compote) with Holunderbeerensaft (fresh elderberry syrup with sparkling water). Can't wait to come back for more desserts!
14195	79	4.0	1	2013-05-22	Very nice place to have lunch and they have amazing desserts!
14196	79	4.0	1	2013-05-14	After a visit to Klimt's famous gold portrait(amazing piece of art) in the Neue Galerie, we stopped at the cafe there for an early lunch. Two in our party had open faced sandwiches ( liverwurst and smoked salmon) accompanied by small salads, both of which were fresh and delicious. All 3 in our party had pastries: linzer tort, lemon curd biscuit and coffee cream pastry - all small and tasty, each 'mit schlag' , fresh whipped cream. All that with one pot of tea to share was $75 - seemed pricey for small plates ( but it is New York), but we were not rushed, and the dark panelled room was cozy. We were lucky to get a banquette looking out at 5th Avenue and Central Park.
14197	79	5.0	1	2013-05-06	Situated inside the Neue Galerie; the perfect place to have a quiet lunch. Beautifully decorated room, much like some of the cafes in Berlin. Great dessert options. The liverwurst spread with onion confit, pistachio chocolate cake, fruit crumble, elderberry syrup with sparkling water, and coffees were all done well.
14198	79	4.0	1	2013-03-05	Housed inside the Neue Galerie, Café Sabarsky offers solid if pricey Austrian fare. The interior veritably screams Wiener Kaffeehaus, dark panels and replicating the Viennese coffee house the venerable institution that played such a large role in the development of Viennese intellectual culture.   I never say no to palačinka (the thin, crêpe-like pancakes common in Central and Eastern Europe) and the Palatschinken mit Räucherforelle & Oberskren (chilled smoked trout crêpes with horseradish and crème fraîche) were phenomenal as well as rich and decadent. This used to be one of the favorite haunts of my half Austrian-half Saudi best friend from LA, I find the overall atmosphere to be slightly fusty and overly formal but would definitely come back for the food.
14199	79	3.0	1	2013-03-03	Not impressed at all. Food is pretty boring while the price is high. We tried just about everything on the menu and nothing worth 2nd visit. It was not too bad, it was just OK, but when you pay $25+tax+ tip for a average plate and $9 ++ for dessert has to be better then what we had.   Sunday late lunch - we waited 25 min for a table. No complains there, just for you to know. Also the place is very nosy.
14200	79	5.0	1	2013-02-27	Overpriced of course but a great setting, top rate coffee, tea, deserts, hot chocolate and austro-germanic food.  A very nice place to take friends, meet that special person.  Not quiet, but intimate and beautiful.
14201	79	4.0	1	2013-01-21	"Entering Sabarsky is just like entering a Viennese cafe.  Deeply carved wooden walls, Wiener Werkstätte accents, and large wooden hangers for the daily newspapers.  The food and ""relaxed"" service is authentic as well. They offer a selection of German/Austrian entrees and desserts.  Most of the entrees are simple but very tasty.  The wursts, spatzle, sauerkraut, and veggies were excellent.  One Americanization is that Weisswurst is available at any time.  The coffee is very good, but not exceptional.  The one downside was the poor pretzels. Overall prices are reasonable, the food authentic, and the atmosphere pleasant.  This is a nice stop when visiting the art museums in the area."
14202	79	4.0	1	2013-01-13	Came here on the way to the Guggenheim and was extremely delighted by the food. Tried the bratwurst with Riesling sauerkraut and potato and the beet salad. Food was excellent! For dessert we shared the apple strudel. Very good, everything in the strudel was handmade an delicious. Service was good whenever you could get ahold of them, restaurant was extremely busy and they could use more help. Aside from that, it was a very good experience.
14203	79	4.0	1	2013-01-12	Roasted bratwurst is great
14204	79	4.0	1	2013-01-11	Food is great, I loved atmosphere and interior design. Because it's not so big place, need to wait for a while. Still inside of restaurant is lovely. Staffs brought wrong plate, but brought new one soon-check your order! Staffs speak quite strong european accent English and they have wonderful german style sausage which made me feel exotic. I didn't like cake so much, but coffee was also great.
14205	79	4.0	1	2013-01-08	Delightful place to rest your weary feet after visiting the museums. If you're lucky, you don't have to wait but around tea time/dinner it gets pretty busy, and you'll have to wait for a table. Dining here makes you feel like you've happened upon a secret little gem...We've only eaten a meal here once. We mainly go for dessert and coffee. The lingertorte thingy is amazing. Get that. The coffee...eh...forgetable (hence the minus 1 star). Though it is served very classy/cute like. I think the thing that keeps me coming back is that Cafe Sabarsky is giving you not just a meal but an experience. For a moment, you forget that you're in Manhattan and instead feel like you really are in some old European cafe (though...this is a funny remark for me to make, because honestly, I don't think I've every been in a European cafe that looks like this...). And this little experience is planned down to the last detail, from the wood paneling to the presentation of food and drink. The waitstaff is attentive and kind. Lovely!
14206	79	4.0	1	2013-01-01	I went here about a month ago for lunch and was so charmed. Lovely spot!
14207	79	4.0	1	2012-12-29	love this place, primarily for the apfelstrudel and the atmosphere.  I have been here many times and sometimes I even have two pieces of apple strudel for dessert (to the surprise of my boyfriend's family who I took here once).   the drinks are also good.  for an extra shot of sugar, i like the elderflower soda with my apfelstrudel. the atmosphere and decor is beautiful, i like the beautiful rooms, the booths, the newspapers, the desserts all lined up against the wall. the other things I eat here are the spicy egg sandwich and also the crab meat salad, both are good, if a bit pricey.
14208	79	3.0	1	2012-12-19	Food was good. Service could be better.
14209	79	3.0	1	2012-12-13	This place was alright. We came here with a friend who loves it, so it was more of an experience for him than for us. I ordered the Sachertorte, which my friend recommended, and an espresso. Both were pretty good. I was apprehensive about the Sachertorte because I expected it to be rich and heavy (which I was not in the mood for) but it was fairly light and tasty. Our service was fairly slow and the waiters seemed a bit inattentive. Otherwise it was an interesting experience. I'd be interested in trying their lunch menu next time.
14210	79	3.0	1	2012-12-08	One line summary: Classy, pricy, delicate desserts and coffee. I had a slice of chocolate cake (to be honest I can't remember what I had exactly ordered) and I liked it well enough, but was not nearly impressed enough to shell out $10 for it. I've had much better desserts for significantly less. Then again, if you're looking for a classier atmosphere in a nice setting, this may be good for you. BE WARNED the line can be very long. We waited for about 30 minutes after joining a relatively short line; the line grew behind us. I would have felt uncomfortable if I had been dressed any more casual (sweater, button down, jeans).
14211	79	3.0	1	2012-11-30	We went here on a weekend mid-day lunch - we didn't browse the museum, and we were really interested in the specific authentic Austrian cuisine.  For the interior design, the place was old-fashioned, high-ceilings with a clean chique look.  We were seated reasonably, but the overall feel of the place was rather stuffy. We ordered our wursts, which were the weisswurst and bratwurst - which were good, but not mind-blowing nor very memorable.  I've been to Berlin twice, and have had sausages larger and tastier.  Their choices were unfortunately bland.  For a cafe, I was hoping for a wide selection of beers, but it looked like more of a Western European motif of a cafe - coffee and sweets. In all honesty, I don't particularly recommend this place if you've been to Germany or Austria.  The interior look and excellent service are nice touches, but doesn't make up for bland sausage.
14212	79	4.0	1	2012-11-23	Café Sabarsky is reminiscent of cafes I've been to in Berlin. From its wood panel walls to its menu items (the names are written in German, but the descriptions are in English), almost everything about it has a European charm. If you're looking to try something that's light and pleasing to the sweet tooth, there's an array of dessert items listed on the menu, which sound perfect for pairing with coffee or tea. A friend and I shared a slightly zesty Zitonenschnitte and a chocolaty Klimttorte with hazelnuts. Both desserts were delightful and were pleasant to the palate. With its classy ambiance but comfortable surroundings, if its an authentic (or near authentic) European cafe experience that you're seeking, then pay a visit to Café Sabarsky.
14213	79	4.0	1	2012-11-13	I had such a craving for their pastry, so I went at dinner time and had the crab and avocado  salad- overdressed, but still tasty, and the chocolate hazelnut cake (Klimttorte), which is fortunately served with whipped cream, because it was a little dry. This is now the second time I've gone and had only so-so results with the dessert.  Disappointing, but I may try again because it's such a nice place to grab a quick bite, and the cakes LOOK so good. :)
14214	79	4.0	1	2012-10-28	Who'd have thunk that I'd find one of the most interesting restaurants out of the hundreds I've eaten in at over the past year at this quaint museum cafe?  Excellent food, remarkable service, grand setting (enjoy the museum if you can--it's an architectural gem and takes all of 20  minutes to walk any show).  Don't go at prime time on a weekend to avoid a line.
14215	79	4.0	1	2012-10-24	This is like walking into an authentic elegant café in downtown Vienna - with the dark wooden panels on the walls, thick curtains and drapes, velvet sofas, coffee being served with water glasses on silver trays, dressed up waiters, and last but not least a fabulous assortment of delicate cakes that make you drewl and want to have it all... Quite classy! We had to wait in line for almost an hour to get in to the street level café but it was definitely worth it. So happy we decided to skip the café at nearby Metropolitan Museum of Art and chose this instead.
14216	79	5.0	1	2012-10-21	The ambiance of this place is something out of Anna Karenina novel :) Very imperial Russia (i.e. dark wood panels on the walls, crystal chandeliers, marble floors, fireplace in the middle of the dining room, grand piano in the corner) even though it is an Austrian restaurant. The food was ok, but I mainly came here for the apple strudel, which did not disappoint. Bonus, there is an art gallery in the same building which at that time was featuring Gustav Klimt.
12568	79	5.0	1	2012-10-20	I came here for a goodbye lunch with a dear friend who was moving out of state, and then again following a photography class that involved lots of trekking around upper Manhattan.  This is a lovely European-style cafe housed in the upscale Neue Galerie, which specializes in German and Austrian art. The cafe does not serve your typical museum-style cafeteria food, and the menu is as elegant as the setting.  You can enjoy a meal here without visiting Neue, but why would you want to do that?  You can have goulash and see art by Klimt, all in one place. The entrance to the cafe is to the right of the museum's front desk, and it is a small place designed to resemble a Viennese cafe of the 1920's/1930's.  The menu is filled with lots of German and Austrian favorites; there are sausage dishes of all kinds, and numerous other delectables, but I skip right past them all and head to the sandwich section of the menu.  My love, the smoked salmon sandwich with cream cheese, capers, and dill, resides there.  Served open-faced, on delicious bread, with a small side salad, it is scrumptious.  I will never be unfaithful to it.  Never. The desserts here are fabulous, and if you don't want to stop in at Cafe Sabarsky for lunch - and I'll admit, it is a little pricey - at least come here for dessert and coffee.  The desserts are all kept on display on a small shelf near the entrance, tempting all who pass with their Siren-like call.  I recommend the linzer tart, with its raspberry filling and powdered sugar, but I have been told that the apple tart and the German chocolate cake are also good. When you are finished with your meal, I recommend heading upstairs to Neue and spending some quality time with Adele Bloch-Bauer.  She's the one on the second floor, wearing the gold dress.  The guy who made her look so good was a popular fellow by the name of Klimt.  Go to Cafe Sabarsky. Go to Neue. Enjoy some German food and some Austrian art, all the while feeling as elegant as Adele.

14218	79	3.0	1	2012-10-15	Since I'm not a big fan of German food, this might not be a fair rating.  Food was good though.  The line for the  upstairs part of the restaurant was too long, so we ate in the downstairs part which is lacking in decor.
5450	79	5.0	1	2012-10-08	Truly excellent and beautifully presented food in refined surroundings. The roasted bratwurst with riesling sauerkruat and potatoes hit the spot on a cold autumn day, as did the glühwein and chocolate cake with cherries and cream. I tasted my friend's espresso with cream and I think I saw God (and that says a lot, coming from an atheist). Worth a special trip.
5668	79	4.0	1	2012-09-04	Cafe Sabarsky is supposedly very authentic and true to a traditional Viennese cafe: from the brocade upholstery to the marble tables to the Michael Thonet chairs. And oh, the food as well. I thought the breakfast here was kind of pricey for what it essentially was: some cold cuts, some bread, some eggs, and some jams, but if Cafe Sabarsky is shooting for authentic, they're nailing it. I found the country bread that came with my ham a little bit too toothsome, but I suppose I've been weaned off the fluffy consistency that is Chinese bread. The brioche, however, was excellent and as was the attentiveness of the servers. I also tried the chocolate and rum cake, which was not quite as chocolatey as I was expecting but I was also informed that Austrian/German cakes are generally just dry and crumbly... Oh my goodness, what a cuisine. Probably would be a good place to come if you wanted to be all old and sniffly and read a week-old Austrian broadsheet on a weekend morning.
14219	79	5.0	1	2012-08-30	One of the best parts of living in NYC is discovering little gems like Cafe Sabarsky, that make you feel like you've escaped to another city/part of the world entirely.  Sabarsky brings back so many great memories of visiting Vienna and is the perfect place to bring guests, especially if you're visiting the Met or Neue Galerie anyway. Be prepared to wait out the inevitable line (do not succumb to the host's suggestions that you dine at Fledermaus downstairs, where the food may be the same but the surroundings are very different), and then settle into one of the tables (or if you're lucky, windowside booths facing Central Park) for an hour or so of quiet elegance.  The food is actually very good (I recommend the Käsekrainer, which is a bratwurst with embedded cheese chunks -- delightful) and they have a full menu of delicious and beautiful Viennese pastries (all served with whipped cream, of course).  It's worth it to just come for a sweet and some coffee to soak in the atmosphere -- do not miss it!
14220	79	5.0	1	2012-08-15	my favorite museum cafe
14221	79	5.0	1	2012-08-13	If you want a great place for kids, a television flashing in the corner, shoveling in the same, boring food you have every day... If you are wearing flip flops and sweatpants and you like to be served by overly chipper / talkative servers then this place is not for you.  head on down to Applebees. If you want to dress up, dine like an adult in a romantic atmosphere with excellent food and service then maybe you should try this place.  The wood paneled walls add a touch or elegance without feeling stuffy.  The servers are there but don't get in the way, the food was delicious.  Everything looked amazing it was hard to decide what to eat. Sure I can't afford to eat like this every day, but for a nice brunch, this is the place to go.

14223	79	5.0	1	2012-07-04	I just love this place. I feel like I am actually in an Austrian Cafe. Great service and wonderful atmosphere and food!
14224	79	2.0	1	2012-06-29	Wow. Talk about nose in the air!  Server with judgmental attitude does not make for a pleasant lunch experience. My friends and I were coming from the Guggenheim and was looking for a place to eat on our way to the American Museum of Natural History.  After some yelping efforts, we came across this place. We were there on a Monday for an early lunch.  The restaurant was half full, the room was pretty dark, but the atmosphere was pretty stuffy.  This is definitely not a kid-friendly place.   Overall, the food was nothing special and overpriced.  While the apple strudel that yelpers were raving about was pretty good, it's not worth coming back for.
14225	79	4.0	1	2012-06-23	Pretty pricey but the food was really good.  The beet salad was excellent and the apple strudel was to die for.  I imagine that the apple strudel in Inglourious Basterds tasted like this. It even tastes good when sitting next to the Nazi that killed your entire family. Inside the Neue Galerie.
14226	79	4.0	1	2012-06-12	A small but chic and great cafe inside the Neue Galerie Museum/Gallery. They have a great selection of Viennese Coffee as well as Viennese specialties like Sausages, Goulash, and a whole selection of Strudels and Chocolate Tortes (cake) to go with your coffee. The decor is cool, artistic, elegant, and comfortable. The place itself decorated with classic Hapsburg style with eye-catching art on the walls. There's even a Grand Piano, a fireplace, and a huge mirror. When I came here today, there were Violinists and Pianists playing some tunes which added to the overall atmosphere of the cafe. I ordered the following desserts: Linzertorte: -Hazelnut Tart with Fresh Raspberry Confiture. This was good and sweet. It didn't wow me but was pretty good and tasted fresh. Came with a side of Whipped Cream Sachertorte: -This is probably their signature dessert. It is a classic Viennese Dark Chocolate Cake with House Made Apricot Confiture. This was very moist and so good! Loved the texture and the dark chocolate was perfect and not overwhelmingly sweet. Great option to go with any coffee! This also comes with a side of Whipped Cream My Drink of Choice: -Einsapanner or Double Espresso with Whipped Cream in a Glass. I gotta tell you, they have really great coffee/espresso here! It was perfect, not super strong like Starbucks' Espresso where your stomach starts growling 5 minutes after you down your Espresso. Service was friendly and attentive and my bill was a bit expensive at $30. I guess the $9 per slice of cake is a bit too expensive but I wanted to try it since I had a sweet tooth and wanted to try a food item here. Now that I did, I'll be coming back here only for the coffee or some other drink in the near future.
14227	79	4.0	1	2012-06-11	I am a big fan of this place.  If you are, say, doing museums with visiting parents, this is almost certainly the best option for lunch within a mile or more.  A beautiful breakfast date location too (and you can beat the line if you come before 11:30 or so, I think). AMBIANCE: This is the main attraction.  High ceilings, amazing wood-lined walls, marble tables, waiters in uniform, a healthy volume of noise but all from conversation.  There's a piano in the corner but I've never seen it deployed (I think they sometimes have cabaret nights?).  The overall impression is of light, airy refinement. FOOD: I find it extremely good, but I almost always get the sandwiches so can't judge everything.  They are a perfect size and the bread is excellent.  Love the herring, the egg w/ paprika, the liverwurst.  The presentation is beautiful too.  The salad with the soft-boiled egg is very nice also. COFFEE: Apparently just so-so, but I can't really comment as I always drink tea, which is done pretty well here (you get your own pot).  I had the Sacher Torte the other day and it was extremely good, with a great depth of flavor from the apricot and liqueur, though I'm sure it does not quite compare to Vienna. SERVICE: A little iffy - yet again a waiter asks if we're done while one of us is chewing and has a morsel left on the plate. PRICE: Fairly high, but it's worth it. The service is holding this down from five stars for me.
14228	79	4.0	1	2012-06-08	I had noble intentions of being cultured for free at the Neue Gallerie...but they gave me such a comfortable banquette seat! So the entire free Friday night was spent luxuriating within cafe Sabarsky's four wood paneled crystal chandelier lighted walls. I was here about a year ago and it was unpleasantly crowded, but this time it was ok. Although I got a sense that the staff was trying to hustle us out a bit we sat around comfortably for an hour and a half. The food is pretty good, though things trend to add up quickly. The coffee and desserts are the stars of the show.
12326	79	3.0	1	2012-06-02	The decor and ambience, I very much enjoy coming here.  The food is great, but I guess the choice of food is very much standard, soup, sausage, sandwich, goulash, not too much variety.  The service is nothing overrated, just standard just like food.  I love coming here for just the dessert and coffee/tea.
8817	79	4.0	1	2012-05-28	I really like this café inside the Neue Gallery for two reasons: the interior is beautiful and the food and atmosphere makes me nostalgic for Vienna. I've had the food here and it's standard German-Austrian fare. Sausages from Schaller and Weber, schnitzels, potatoes, sauer kraut. Frankly, nothing special but the pastries and coffee is excellent. Granted the sacher torte is not quite up to par with the Viennese original but it is pretty good. So I've come here for coffee and cake sometimes and enjoyed the people watching.
14229	79	5.0	1	2012-05-12	Been coming here for 4 years almost every week. They have the best coffee and desserts (apple strudel), and the ambience is great. Waitstaff is very attentive and courteous. Wait can be very long for lunch though so come early.
14230	79	2.0	1	2012-04-27	Cheese in dishes was served cold instead of room temperature.  Soup was watery.  Waitress was rude.  Excellent bread.  It is a pretty place but the prices are too high, even for Manhattan.  Desserts look lovely.
14231	79	4.0	1	2012-04-25	Must try if you are in the area! Great food and fantastic service! Only con would be that there is usually a line for a table... It took us about 20 minutes to get seated and it was about 2pm on a Friday. And there is really no where to sit when waiting... But other than that, you won't be disappointed! :)
14232	79	3.0	1	2012-04-18	I thought this place was nice and different but definitely pricey for what you get.  I had the Gekochter Schinken mit frischem Kren  (Yes... I copied and pasted that) which was Cooked ham on Egg Spread with fresh Horseradish for $14. Again, it tasted good but mainly because the horseradish gave it a little kick.   The service was a bit all over the place, but maybe because it was during lunch. I think it's great to try this place at least once and you decide.
14233	79	4.0	1	2012-04-10	Weiner schnitzel and apfelstrudel. Can't go wrong. Tasty espresso
5707	79	3.0	1	2012-04-08	20% service charge parties 5+ DECOR: 4/5 -The high ceilings and wood design gave it a traditional Viennese feeling (or so I've been told) -Lots of tables with a few booths. SERVICE: 2/5 -Service was very slow. FOOD: 3.5/5 -Apfelstrudel ($9): A traditional Viennese strudel. I love the crispy phyllo. The apple was ok. It was either the texture or type of apple used. -Hausgemachtes musli mit Joghurt & Honig ($6): Served in a large bowl with homemade granola and yogurt with a raspberry on top. The yogurt was fluffy and not thick that was slightly sour. The granola had a decent mix of dried fruits. I had mixed feelings about this dish. -Peach Fruit nectar ($4): Comes in a four ounce bottle. I decided to try this since a Coke/Diet Coke was $4.
14234	79	5.0	1	2012-04-07	"In attempts to avoid cafeteria food or street meat for lunch while visiting the Met, we walked over to this nearby location.  To our dismay, we arrived at Neue Galerie (a German museum) where Sabarsky was located.  Alas, we had given up one museum's cafe for another.  However, upon reading an acceptable menu and catching whiffs of meat and potatoes, we decided to digest the 15-minute wait and try it out.  Quickly, a line formed behind us, all willing to wait for a table.  The lunch gods were sending us happy omens. As we were seated, I instantaneously felt as a being of higher class.  The dining room was of a simple arrangement, including cafe chairs, marble table-tops, and upholstery all around.  The walls were beautifully adorned dark wood from floor to ceiling, with windows overlooking Central Park.  Wise music delicately filled the quite crevices of the cafe, while all of the daily papers were neatly hung on a rack for the undoubted regulars that frequent this spot. We began with a selection of their signature beverages, my favorite of which was the Gurkenlimonade (Cucumber Juice with Sparkling Lemonade).  It was an eerily green color, but absolutely refreshing.  I was surprised by the fact that the cucumber flavor was more prominent than the lemon. Kleines Wr. Schnitzel (""Small"" Veal Wiener Schnitzel):  If this is a small schnitzel, a big one must be the size of the whole plate.  The veal was very soft and flavorful, and the crust had a great crunch without being overly greasy. Ungarisches Rindsgulasch (Hungarian Beef Goulash):  Very tender beef in a greatly flavorful stew.  It had a clearly complex spice palate that begged to be soaked up with bits of bread.  The accompanying spatzle was so delicate and light that it practically fell apart upon touching your tongue. Weisswurst mit Brezen (Bavarian Sausage with Pretzel):  A bockwurst-like, ligthly colored, lean sausage.  Boiled and delicious, served with an amazing pretzel...crisp outer skin with a warmed and soft doughy center. The Apple Strudel and Sachertorte were a bit of a disappointment and not worth mentioning, but did not change the fact that our entrees were luxuriously satisfying. BEWARE:  They automatically charged 20% gratuity on our check, regardless of the fact that we were a party of four."
14235	79	4.0	1	2012-04-02	I thought this place was charming. I had the Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut and thought the portions were just right. But I think the real draw of this place are the unique drink offerings and the dessert menu so I will be back to sample those.
14236	79	5.0	1	2012-04-01	What a wonderful brunch location! We waited about 20 minutes for a table, but it was worth it. Beautiful Viennese dining room atmosphere--it felt like we were transported to Austria. I strongly recommend the hot chocolate; it was just sweet enough. The coffee is superb as well. Sandwiches are a perfect portion, and open-faced. I recommend the spicy egg sandwich. My only quibble was with the chocolate marzipan cake, which was a little dry. However, the lemon biscuit was good and I'm sure their other desserts are great.
14237	79	4.0	1	2012-03-14	So nice place! A lot of desserts and my favorite nougat covered hazelnuts:)
8899	79	3.0	1	2012-03-01	I came here looking forward to try Viennese style chocolate. I tried the Viennese Hot Chocolate with whipped cream and the Sachertorte (talk about a chocolate overload). I was dissapointed about the hot chocolate. Not bad, but nothing special. You can pass on this one. But the sachertorte...very good!!! I have tried the sacher cake in swiss cafes and I expected something less sweet but it was so delicious that I didn't care. This cake has picked my curiosity and I will definitely come back to try more desserts!
14238	79	4.0	1	2012-02-29	Beautiful place and DELICIOUS. Had the glorious hot chocolate, yummy white sausage and pretzel, and an almond paste chocolate cake dessert :))))))
14239	79	4.0	1	2012-02-20	The apple strudel was a hit. Flaky and not too sweet. I had a simple breakfast yesterday: 2 eggs and toast.  The twist was that the soft boiled eggs were served in a martini glass, so you could dip your toast in the yolky mix.  Clever!
14240	79	5.0	1	2012-02-11	Dined here after a long day of walking both to and around the Met. It's conveniently located about 4 blocks north of the museum. Food was tasty, and service was fine - attentive, but not exactly warm and cuddly. I highly recommend the Elderflower sparkling water drink - it's light and refreshing and not overly sweet (Hollerblueten, $4). I had the smoked brats entree (Kasekrainer, $14) - they are stuffed with oozy cheese and served over a bed of sauerkraut alongside roasted potatoes and a dollop of dijon mustard. Really quite tasty. Hit the spot after all that walking, and I felt the amount was about right, neither too much nor too little. I've also never been the biggest sauerkraut fan, but I truly enjoyed this stuff. It was mild but provided just the right kick of flavor to compliment the sausage. I could have stopped there and been satisfied for the evening, but I feel dessert is a necessary extravagance when traveling, so I ordered the strawberry and elderflower mousse layered cake (Erdbeer Holler, $9). It was surprisingly light and fluffy. The mousse wasn't heavy at all, and there a small dollop of unsweetened whipped cream on the top that kept everything balanced. The lightness of the dessert was a nice finisher to the heavier entree. Oh, and the best feature of the restaurant is the lights over the booths. They are just plain awesome and unique. All in all, a satisfying experience. I would happily go back.
14241	79	4.0	1	2012-01-15	Cafe Sabarsky was recommended to me by a classmate who said it was like stepping into a Vienesse cafe. I completely agree with him. I was satisfied with my lunch of Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut and the sachertorte for dessert. Most of all, I was very pleased to be dining with a view of Central park and to be so close to the MET. On a practical note, I suggest making a reservation for lunch. I went on a Tuesday afternoon and had to wait a half an hour for a table for two.
14242	79	4.0	1	2011-12-27	After an afternoon at the Guggenheim museum, all I wanted to do was sit, enjoy a snack and rest my feet. I quickly Yelped cafes near the museum and found Cafe Sabarsky conveniently located a few blocks away. After reading many favorable reviews, we were on our way. I loved the vibe; very old world European. I had the fresh elderflower syrup with sparkling water - it was interesting, but a tad sweet so I probably wouldn't get it again. My friend got the latte; it was very good. We also tried the apple strudel - it was served cold; I didn't really enjoy that, but the whipped cream they served with it was delicious. I think it was made in-house, it wasn't overly sweet but rich. The highlight of our visit though was the pretzel - warm, crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside, served with a grainy honey mustard. So good! Had I not already had plans for dinner that night, I probably would've ordered another... just for myself! I definitely want to come back sometime to have a meal.
14243	79	5.0	1	2011-12-26	WOW! Exactly the kind of place I'm craving for! I was introduced to that place by a German colleague. I specified it on purpose. As a German citizen he knows the classics when it comes to German/Austrian dishes! He brought me to that Viennese restaurant. I was really doubtful about Austrian specialties. For some reason, I used to think of it as really heavy cuisine lacking any sense of subtlety and elegance. Well, I was entirely wrong. The ambiance really puts you in an upscale Viennese bistro back in the 70s: AMAZING! The menu is written in German with English subtitles, you can actually challenge you pronunciation skills. My German is awful, I didn't even dare a try! I can't remember the name the dish I've chosen, but it was a classic Austrian noodle dish, really fine, nothing arrogant, but amazingly tasty. Now comes the dessert: Apfelstrudel. I don't even know how to describe what is so far the BEST DESSERT I HAD. It's a really traditional apple based dessert, but it blew my mind for the years to come! I have always wanted to taste an apple strudel since I saw that Tarantino's movie: Inglorious Baterds. The strudel scene with the nazi officer triggered something inexplicable about that dessert. If you ever felt like me, please go the Cafe Sabarsky and nowhere else.
14244	79	2.0	1	2011-12-19	"I see that I'm in the minority in giving Cafe Sabarsky a lower rating, but ""Meh.  I've experienced better"" is honest, based on my experiences dining here.  It's true that the upstairs restaurant is like a Viennese cafe, I just wish the food were on the same level as the decor!  Downstairs isn't much as far as the that goes - nice enough, but nothing special.  It has the same menu but the service was nowhere near as good as it usually is in the upstairs restaurant.  But there was a long wait for upstairs, and after about 20-30 mins with no movement of the line, we gave up and headed for the basement.   Basically, this cafe is uber expensive and more about the atmosphere than the food.  The upstairs restaurant is a very ornate room and feels almost like being in Europe.   I like that they have newspapers available for patrons to read.  But sadly, that's the best I can say about Cafe Sabarsky.  The food is fair to middling - and I would recommend the entrees over the desserts. Service is usually not great. Don't say I didn't warn you -- the hot chocolate is seriously overpriced at $7.50 for a tiny cup -- makes Starbucks seem like a major bargain!  Here, you'll be presented with about 3-4 ounces of hot chocolate (reminiscent of  a dixie cup)  and about 1/3 is whipped cream anyway.  (See photos but  for scale, note that the spoon is tiny.)  With tax and tip, it comes to $10 for a few sips, and I didn't think it tasted any better than the hot chocolate you can get anywhere else.  Not the rich, deep hot chocolate that you'd expect.   And the price is exhorbitant, even by NYC standards.  Over $100 for 4 hot chocolates, 4 slices of cake ($9 each, all a variety of chocolate, all very bland and not rich and chocolatey as one would expect), a coffee ($6, just regular coffee) and a wine.  The server, who was very slow although there were only one or two other tables, added a 20% tip to the bill.  I usually tip 20%, but not for that kind of service! Next time I will go to the cupcake stand in front of the Met - seriously, it is much tastier and costs 1/5 of what we shelled out for a disappointing experience at Cafe Sabarsky.  I may still come back for the beef stew or something like that, but not for a hot drink or dessert."
14245	79	2.0	1	2011-12-01	I'm from San Francisco, and am used to pretty good food.  Came here for lunch while we were spending a day at the Met.  Terrible service -- had to wave and flag the server down for everything, and when he did come by, wasn't very helpful. Brats were good and the stew was pricey but pretty good as well.  Beet salad was good.  Nothing spectacular but good enough for a hungry crowd. The apple dessert and hazelnut tart were probably some of the worst desserts I've ever tasted.  Stale and just overall terrible -- tasted like something from Safeway that had been sitting out for a week. Ambiance is kinda intimate and nice, but there are so many better places to go in NYC.  Would not recommend.
14246	79	1.0	1	2011-11-25	Worst Viennese restaurant in the world. Soggy Wiener schnitzel. Batter fried in oil tasting of fish. Meat,if it was veal,not pounded thin. Sachertorte insults Hotel Sacher. Mixed salad insipid. Coffee like dishwater.
14247	79	5.0	1	2011-10-30	I haven't been to many German restaurants, but from now on if I ever visit one, I will have to compare it to the excellent dining experience I enjoyed at Cafe Sabarsky. The food here is unarguably authentic. Sausages, boiled meat, goulash, and a favorite of mine, spatzle. Have I mentioned the desserts such as the apple strudel, sachertorte, and the wonderful coffees and of course the Viennese hot chocolate? I may not be a frequent visitor to German restaurants here in NY, but I will definitely be a frequent visitor to Sabarsky.
14248	79	4.0	1	2011-10-18	This place is one of the fanciest cafe's I've seen. It's like a high class Starbucks with art and the servers are wearing collared shirts and slacks. This is a smaller version of Angelina in Paris where you get to appreciate more of the scenery than just the coffee itself. The wood paneling in this place was part of the original motif, maybe some old oak. As I am enjoying the scenery, I also took on some of their hot chocolate yelp.com/biz_photos/_NS1… and Linzetorte hazelnut tart and raspberry confiture yelp.com/biz_photos/_NS1…. Of course this place was a great setting for eating these desserts and sweets. They do breakfast too, but to have some nice hot chocolate definitely made my start here worth coming. Very nicely made. Besides the wood paneling, they also have some really high ceilings, again authentic stuff, kinda looks like it came from a museum. The original fireplace and a large mirror over the fireplace looked archaic.
14249	79	4.0	1	2011-10-14	"Came here for lunch on Saturday and what a treat! We had: The smoked Bratwurst with cheese: This was a decent dish. I felt the sausage could have been a bit more flavorful. The kraut and potatoes were good. Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut: This was really good! The sausage was flavorful and awesome. The kraut and potatoes were the same as the other dish. Soft pretzel with traditional honey mustard: WOW. The mustard was so damn good. I think it was all about the mustard. For dessert: Milchrahmstrudel: Pretty good. Came with a vanilla sauce. Apple Strudel: OMG, I could have this all day. Yelpers were not wrong about the apple strudel! We also had the hot chocolate (rich and sweet) and the Wiener Mélange. This place really does have a ""cafe"" atmosphere. Not stuffy at all, people reading newspapers and very comfortable. Service was really good and friendly but they also left you alone if you wanted. Not to mention that this is right next to the Met and a great place to have breakfast or lunch before heading to the museum. Overall a great experience."
14250	79	5.0	1	2011-09-29	A beautiful setting. I had a perfect erbsensuppe mit minze, and then a milchkaffee with a sinful topfentorte. Vienna in New York.
14251	79	4.0	1	2011-08-30	If you ever feel the need to punish your heart with absurd amounts of heavy cream and sausage - this is the place for you. The pastries are amazing (read: butter), as well as the coffee. You can even get full meals, but that didn't seem to be the main draw. It is pretty classy without being pretentious. The service was prompt and nice. I think the prices are really high (for what amounts to an extravagant coffee house) , but if you want to eat right on central park, you have to pay.
14252	79	5.0	1	2011-08-22	My friends and I went to Cafe Sabarsky last Sunday afternoon. We are party of 7. The restaurant is under renovated, but they serve the same menu at the basement. The ice coffee is AWESOME!!!!!! It's the one with vanilla ice cream. U must order Smoked Bratwurst stuffed with Cheddar Cheese served with Sauerkraut, Roasted Potatoes & Dijon. Dessert- Strongly recommend!!!!! Btw, the host is super cute! The servers are so nice!!!!!! Definately I'm going back soon~
14253	79	3.0	1	2011-08-16	I spent 5 weeks in Vienna studying art and design...and of course sitting in as many classic viennese cafes as I could like cafe sperl, drechsler, etc. This decor and menu are definitely viennese inspired with steam bent thonet chairs, marble, etc. I only ordered a wiener melange and a marble pound cake, but looking around the food looked pretty good. The melange, a coffee drink created in vienna, was good and served with obligatory glass of water. The marble cake was dry but ok when eaten with the fresh whipped cream. In general, I would not recommend the sachertorte, although this is the quintessential viennese dessert and favorite of emperor franz josef. It's chocolate cake with apricot jam. I had sachertorte at the original sacher hotel near operngasse and I have no idea why people like this cake. It's very dry and rather tasteless. I didn't dare order it at the cafe but I tried asking the waiter if it was dry...I don't think he understood my question. Overall, I think it's a great place to try to recreate a viennese experience. They even serve amdudler. There aren't many places IMHO to eat around the Met, but I think Cafe Sabarsky is a great option and great place to bring friends and family. Because it is a rather small place and it sounds like there is often a line, I don't think it is a a real cafe where you can just lounge around and read. In vienna, if you order a cup of coffee, you can sit in the cafe all day and no one would bother you. Of course, that is not the case here which is too bad.
14254	79	5.0	1	2011-08-08	Best Austrian desserts and coffee. Really does feel like a Viennese cafe. I like here: Goulash soup Spatzle All sausages Hungarian goulash Sandwiches Sachertorte Apple strudel Viennese hot chocolate with shlag Any coffee style
14255	79	1.0	1	2011-08-07	Overpriced, mediocre food, with a decor that's nowhere near nice enough to make up for it
14256	79	3.0	1	2011-07-28	"I am always on the hunt for great dessert places, so I was so happy and giddy when I discovered Cafe Sabarsky via Yelp. I don't usually venture out to this part of the neighborhood, so the place has been on my ""to-try"" list for a good year.  Anyway, I finally sucked it up and planned a nice Saturday morning around it hoping to discover my new favorite dessert spot. I have to say, they do have a great selection of desserts and coffee, my friend and I decided on two different cakes to share: a dense chocolate cake and a more fluffy strawberry version. Both were decent, but nothing spectacular, and I was left feeling a bit unsatisfied. To add onto it, the cakes were on a pricier side. At $8 a slice I wish it tasted more up to par, because I really really really wanted to like this place."
14257	79	4.0	1	2011-07-12	I had a very enjoyable meal here after going to the Met. The service was good, food was well prepared, and the prices matched the quality of the food. The interior was very classic, with burgundy wood paneling and a feel of elegance. The mustards they have are very tasty. The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought the portions were a bit too small.
12499	79	5.0	1	2011-06-15	Great spot for lunch and desserts. The atmosphere is lovely and the food is even lovelier. All their sandwiches are great, the goulash is amazing here, the sausage salad is perfect and the vinegar dressing really makes it. What really wins my heart here is all their desserts . The best apple strudel is definitely here it's the perfect texture and just melts in your mouth. All their other tea cakes are amazing and  their chocolate cakes are also great.  You just can't go wrong with dessert here because everything is so delicious. The pastries here are perfect for take-out as well.
14258	79	1.0	1	2011-06-13	I can't understand how anyone could give this place any stars at all.  This place is so overrated!  It's like a food court at a mall. It's just a room with some tables, with no view of anything.   The fixtures and design of the coffee bar don't match the period of the room and made the room seem messy. Bad Feng Shui. The food was awful:  soggy sauerkraut, crab salad with bits of crab shell mixed in  & the most DREADFUL coffee ever.
14259	79	3.0	1	2011-06-10	Wish I had gone here for coffee and cake instead of breakfast. I had the Sabarsky Fruhstuck and it was just OK, not worth the price. Wasn't impressed with the breads or jams. Came with ham and soft-boiled eggs but no cheese. Coffee was nice and I liked the decor and ambiance except for the flies. Service was a bit cold. Come after you visit the museum, not before.
14260	79	2.0	1	2011-04-28	Having read most of the Yelp reviews and finally gone, I've satisfied my curiosity and probably won't go back.  Yes, the food is flavorful and the atmosphere beautiful.  Service was courteous.  BUT, most things seem $5 too much.   Friends had the weisswurst with sauerkraut, horseradish mustard.  They said it was good.  I had the goulash - which turned out to be a tomato-based soup with small chunks of beef and potatoes.  Tasty but not $14 tasty.  I at least expected some sort of cool presentation but it came in a bowl; soup had been sloshed onto the rim of the bowl by the time it reached me.  The $9 sacher torte was good too but I think at most $7 would have been appropriate.  Not too sweet with just a touch of apricot jam to complement the chocolate cake.  All in all, for this kind of cash, I'd rather go somewhere else.
14261	79	5.0	1	2011-04-13	gorgeous hapsburg style decor delicious and surprisingly not super expensive food SACHERTORTE ($8 a slice but i'd pay double because it's fucking SACHERTORTE) ummm yeah also the bread basket they give you is literally overflowing and this isn't cheesecake factory bread, hunny bunnies. i can't say enough good things about cafe sabarsky. my favorite place to eat in nyc by far.
14262	79	4.0	1	2011-03-30	"FOOD: Having recently returned from a trip to Austria, I was interested in trying a place with some Austrian specialties to see if it was possible to get some of the same things here in the US. Cafe Sabarsky was on that list. I ordered a Kasekreiner for my meal, and my guest ordered the potato spatzle. Both were delicious. The kasekreiner was appropriately cooked in such a way that the inside of the sausage was soft while the exterior appropriately ""tough."" The mustard in particular for the kasekreiner was superb and appropriately spicy, and the potato and sauerkraut served on the side was delicious. Bread was fresh also. They served Stiegl beer imported from Salzburg which was a very pleasant surprise. No Ottakringer (a Viennese beer), but that is not distributed widely outside the east of Austria anyway so it would be a bit much to see that here. Either way the Stiegl was much appreciated and tasted same as in Austria (all Stiegl is brewed in Salzburg and imported). For dessert, we ordered the Sachertorte, an Austrian specialty and quite possibly my favorite dessert in this entire world. A slice of chocolatey ""pie"" almost, served with whipped creme on the side, it is a true Viennese treat. The flavor compared pretty well to the ""real thing"" from Vienna I'd had a few weeks earlier, the only notable difference being the texture (the Viennese version was slightly softer). All in all, a very good casual dining experience. 5/5 SERVICE: Service was quite good. No complaints. The food came surprisingly quickly. Waiter was polite and friendly. It did take a little while to get seated however, and they don't take reservations for lunch. Their hours are somewhat limited by the Neue Galerie, and so dinner is only available later in the week. Also, this was the second time I'd gone and first time I'd eaten. The first time I visited, they'd failed to note their regular hours were not in effect on their website due to a special event, and so we were turned away. So even though the service in the restaurant was good, their score here reflects reduced dinner hours and the incomplete information on the website somewhat also. 3/5 AMBIENCE: Very simple ambience, casual, quiet, and potentially romantic. Overall, the cafe is fairly small so if you are going to do dinner here, reservations are highly recommended (particularly if you have a larger party). Seating two is no problem but seating four at a table may become slightly cramped unless you get a booth. All in all, the place is well decorated and carries a nice vibe. 4/5 PRICE/VALUE: The prices are fairly high but in my opinion the food is worth it. This is a nice place to go, and it can be romantic if you are considering taking a date here. Just be sure to check their hours before visiting, and if you plan on eating dinner here on a day that they are open late, be sure to make reservations as it is not very large. 4/5 SUMMARY: Cafe Sabarsky is well respected in the German/Austrian cuisine circles and for good reason. You will enjoy the food and the elegant ambience here. 4/5"
14263	79	3.0	1	2011-03-21	I suppose the one liner for this place would be.  Great ambiance, but mediocre food.   In concept, it seemed like a great idea.  A richly anointed room turned cafe; however, it just didn't have the food to match.  The best word for the food would be forgettable.  We came for bunch on a Sunday, and everything we tried was unremarkable.  So much so that my cousin who usually loves desserts couldn't even persuade herself to order one and we walked 6 blocks to Lady M, which we knew to have solid desserts.   I would also recommend against the coffee.  It's essentially an espresso lungo which would be fine if they had fresher beans and were better at pulling shots.
14264	79	5.0	1	2011-03-14	"It was dinner at either Cafe Sabarsky or the Trustees' dining room at the Met down the road a piece. In the end, the Austrian sirens proved most potent...besides, we wanted to see the fabulous Klimts at the Neue Galerie and proximity proved powerful - the Cafe being on the first floor and all. Picture a dark chestnut-paneled room with a herringbone hardwood floor and high ceilings, a small bar at one end and tables and booths comfortably placed, starched white table cloths everywhere, silver gleaming and wine glasses glowing in the afternoon light. (I ought to copyright that sentence for over-heated, serial alliteration.) We had taken the precaution of previously printing out the on-line menu, better to be prepared for the moment when we heard the words,""May I take your order?"" Although the menu has a breakfast section, there was no separate listing for dinner entrees. But there are plenty of choices to allow for mixing und matching und sharing, so we chose and shared. None of these offerings is especially expensive (dare I refer to $$$ in a Yelp review? Sure. We're all friends, here.) But, your sense of adventure can run away with your dinner budget, so we were lucky to find a free parking space on Fifth Avenue. We started with a couple of glasses of a very nice Grüner Veltliner - Organic, followed by a couple of glasses of New York water - also organic (on the house). Then, on to the food. First, a lovely Friséesalat mit Speck und weichem Ei (frisee Salad with Bacon, soft boiled Egg and Lemon-Vinaigrette), which we shared. Yummy! Next a Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut & Röstkartoffeln (Roasted Sausage with Riesling Sauerkraut, Roasted Potatoes & Dijon.) Again, scrummy - but (chef - are you listening???) the potatoes were a bit undercooked for my taste.) Next, the Kleines Weiner Schnitzel mit Kartoffel - Gurkensalat & Preiselbeeren (small Wiener Schnitzel with Potato-Cucumber Salad & Lingonberries) and the Palatschinken mit Räucherforelle & Oberskren (chilled smoked trout crêpes & horseradish & crème fraîche). The quality of the food was excellent - the schnitzel was perfectly cooked and the palatschinken with smoked trout was heavenly (but served cold - so, you're warned). A brief digression about palatschinken: when I was a kid, there was a restaurant nearby called the Claremont Diner (google for a full discussion). One of the most intriguing items on the menu was Palatschinken with Preiselbeeren. Never had it, though - my parents would have thought I was nuts to order something so old world. Now, here they both were (although each part of another dish), on the Sabarsky menu!, and no parents around to say no. So, looking over my shoulder for dirty looks, I took some of the Preiselbeeren and spread it on the Palatschinken. WHOA! SO GOOD! The sweetness of the lingonberries was a great match for the smokiness of the trout. Next time, I'll ask for some extra Preiselbeeren on the side in a monkey dish All the above were shared. Our waiter, Greg, was pleasant and very professional and responsive. Used silverware was replaced with each course (nice!!!). Sabarsky is a great place for a once-a-year treat. Do it when you can."
12716	79	4.0	1	2011-02-28	great goulash and service. A variety of desserts make this an ideal stop.
14265	79	4.0	1	2011-02-26	"Most of the reviews... along with most of the advice we got from friends... said this place ""has great desserts, but the food is mediocre and way too expensive."" As usual, most people are wrong. The food was excellent. We had a variety of sausages, and they all were good. Plump, tasty, without whatever it is that comes back at you to make you reach for the TUMS. The spätzel was also excellent, good flavoring and not as obnoxiously gooey as it often is. The desserts WERE terrific, as was the Austrian whipped cream heavy coffee. The only taste disappointment was the Austrian beer, Stiegl Lager. It had... I donno how to describe it... a taste like hay? The service too was great. Very professional, but not overly formal or stiff-necked. It IS expensive, but once in a couple months, it's worth it. --Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons"
14266	79	5.0	1	2011-02-22	monday afternoon. still love it here and wish it could be a secret.  each time i visit i'm surrounded by germans and austrians so as they say, it must be good. the service is always what lacks most.  it's moderately attentive, but too quick and insincere.  the hostess is pleasant. lastly, if you're planning on visiting you may want to call ahead either day or night, i've come by and it was closed for private events, very disappointing as it can be a schlep to get to.
14267	79	5.0	1	2011-02-19	I've been to cafe Sabarsky three times and every time i go it's just as great- or even better. Firstly, if youre planning on adventuring, Sabarsky is located right on museum row and is across from central park. Secondly, the food is perfectly cooked and the presentation is picturesque. And most importantly, the service is impeccable! You can tell that the people who work there enjoy their jobs and the energy is positive. I had the pleasure of being served by stephan! He's very charming, helpful and polite. Everything he suggested was delicious. For once i felt like the waiter didn't just suggest the most expensive thing on the menu!! He paced the meal very well. He didn't bother us but he also payed attention to the table and made himself available when needed. Though Sabarsky is a bit on the expensive side, it's totally worth the extra few bucks. You're getting outstanding service, filling/ healthy/ tasty food, and a very calming eating environment. Also, the last time I was at Sabarsky, I sat next to Natalie Portman! Supposedly, if you wanna go celebrity stalking Sabarsky is the place to go! Last time I was there I had: -weiner snitzel -lemon biscuit (desert) -gruener veltiner (wine) :)
14268	79	5.0	1	2011-02-19	Ah, the pleasures of lunching with the parental units! On my own, i would probably stop by for an occasional coffee and dessert splurge. Today, however, the parentals invited me to a full meal. ¡Gracias! If I were evaluating food only, I would probably give Sabarsky a 4, but my rating reflects the entire Sabarsky experience. Yes, it's an experience. The restaurant is located in the beautiful Neue Gallery. The space itself immediately transported me to Vienna until I noticed parental unit 1 asking questions about the menu in Spanish. I had the opportunity to sample several dishes. Here are some of the highlights: - Lovely Austrian white wines. They're a bit sweet for my taste, but certainly worth sampling. - The sausages are wonderful. You may find them a bit bland if you prefer Italian, Spanish and Latin American varieties, but they are cooked to perfection. - I recommend you eat the sausages with Sabarsky's mustard, which is simply heaven. - The warm pretzel bread is addictive. - The weiner schnitzel is fried to perfection, so there's no grease, and it comes with a potato and cucumber concoction that was delightful. - The cakes are tasty and delicate, and they come with homemade whipped cream. - The coffee is, in a word, perfect. Heads up: the Neue Gallery is closed for a week or so. We were a little disappointed, as we had our hearts set on a German Expressionist post-meal stroll. We went to the nearby Jewish Museum instead, which, by the way, is free on Saturdays. I greatly enjoyed the temporary Houdini. In sum... - Lunch at Café Sabarsky: $60/person - Entrance to Jewish Museum on Saturday: Free - Watching the parental units bask in their Jewishness at the Jewish Museum after a delightul meal at Café Sabarsky: Priceless. I should eat with them ol' folks more often.
14269	79	4.0	1	2011-01-23	"What makes a grand cuisine? What are the necessary elements - culture, diversity, wealth and therefore leisure, adventurous spirit, tolerance, favorable weather (for availability of ingredients) and, most of all, correct and due appreciation of good food? Culinary talent is an art that must be nurtured and developed by patrons - think the electrifying environment of the Renaissance and the pasta and gelato. However, even when a country has all the elements, a great tradition of food does not necessarily follow: e.g. London, New York and Vienna. This is, of course, a generalization of vast proportions, and there are always exceptions; however, exceptions are not the norm. What is the probability of you walking on the streets of New York and hit a decent restaurant? Incalculably low. Nevertheless, despite the adversities, there are still a few things that lesser cuisines excel - even the Austrian. Despite the glamour of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the intellectual crucible of the late Nineteenth Century - I wonder what Freud would have said about the development of food in his native land - which had built the grand palaces and grew Art Nouveau, the food scene seemed to have stagnated and stopped in cafés. Since my intended trip to Vienna was turned into a trip to the South America, I headed over to Café Sabarsky to lose myself in the bygone era of the Austro-Hungarian tradition. Wiener Mélange Having failed most gloriously the last time by ordering the Kaiser Mélange - Fresh-ground Coffee with Whipped Cream - because my coffee was buried under a snow mountain of whipped cream so that the experience was more of ingesting slightly warmed whipped cream rather than drinking coffee, I opted this time, for the safe latte-sounding concoction. However, the espresso was mere dark brown water with barely a hint of the brew it purported to be. Kaffee The coffee was advertised as ""freshly ground,"" therefore, it was even more astonishing for the sheepish and insipid want of taste. It was no wonder then that the whipped cream overwhelmed the coffee in my Kaiser Mélange the last time. A café serving coffee minus the coffee-ness seems almost like an oxymoron, and it would have been brushed aside if not for its lovingly executed café menu. Palatschinken mit Räucherforelle & Oberskren - Chilled Smoked Trout Crêpes & Horseradish, Crème Fraîche The thin and yet sturdy crepe tightly rolled in the delicately smoked trout into an equal-thickness cylinder from head to tow (if there was such a thing for a crepe) - by a pair of deft hands, no doubt. The tender trout was flaky and moist, while the starch of the crepe added substance to the texture. On the other hand, the mache played a vivid side role to the dish - for the conceptions both culinary and picturesque. A few dollops of the fresh cream completed the happy family of trout, crepe and mache on my quick-moving fork. Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut & Röstkartoffeln - Roasted Sausage with Riesling Sauerkraut, Roasted Potatoes & Dijon Simple grilled bratwurst literally and figuratively burst open in an outburst of steamy meaty fragrance at the touch of the knife. Chewy and juicy sausage married with the sauerkraut alone would have made the Kaiser - Franz Josef appeared to be a man of simple pleasures - blissfully happy; but when you smeared the pungent Dijon mustard on them both, it would have been a formidable study of sensual symbolism and subconscious desires worth many sessions on Freud's couch. Rehrücken* - Chocolate Marzipan Cake with house made Orange Confiture Deceptively heavy on the appearance but meltingly light on the palate, the chocolate cake was an interesting sensation of density and lightness. First the exterior ganache would melt to coat the marzipan chocolate cake inside, whose initial thickness on the tongue would be warmed to a velvety smoothness by your tongue rolled the piece in enjoyment. The zesty orange confiture stood out against the dark chocolate, and yet it was mindful of the harmony of the whole. Apfelstrudel* The simple apple strudel disappointed despite the approvingly layered pie crust: The apples inside lacked the bright acidity or the mellow sweetness. By no means excusable, but somewhat understandable, the failure might have been a one-time irregularity due to the unavailability of good apples. The fair snow-white whipped cream (Magic Mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest one of all? - Shlag) more than appeased other lacks thereof: Fair skin hides seven flaws - Japanese proverb. * mit Schlag / * with whipped cream On the dessert menu, an asterisk indicated desserts that would come with the effortlessly light whipped cream. However, when most of the items did indeed come with the customary schlag, wouldn't the asterisks better be used to indicate what would come without the cream in order not to disappoint the shlag-addicted clientele?"
14270	79	4.0	1	2011-01-04	The food is delicious; I had never tried food of Austrian influence but this was great and I can't believe I've waited this long. The place is beautiful as it's inside the Neue Gallery & Museum and after the meal if you'd like to visit the exhibit it's a very nice experience. The ambiance of the cafe is absolutely stunning; it truly captures the feel of the upper Central Park East with a very artsy and cultured atmosphere. The service is also very good. I felt very comfortable and attended to; the servers were friendly and considerate of the customers. IRRELEVANT NOTE: One little thing I want to mention; my friends and I sat at the table right next to Yoko Ono. I don't know why she was right there but it was definitely her. She kind of glared at us for staring too much.
14271	79	5.0	1	2011-01-01	the Milchrahmstrudel (Quark Cheese Strudel with Vanilla Sauce) was easily the best pastry to ever pass my lips. get it. love it. deal with the crowd... it's worth it.
14272	79	5.0	1	2010-12-23	I love this place. This is the place I flee to when my nostalgia for Vienna is too strong. They are only missing a piano player to completely placate my nostalgia. The atmosphere is amazing. The goulash soup with potatoes and melange tastes just the same as the best cafes in Vienna. But Austrian cuisine wouldnt be Austrian without the dessert. Everyone usually goes for the Sachertorte or chocolate, but I think their Topfentorte (quark cheesecake) is the highlight.
14273	79	3.0	1	2010-12-21	I had been there a few years back - maybe when it was relatively new. Have to say I was disappointed the last time I visited (this month). Why?  The food is great, authentic Austrian etc. BUT the ambience has taken a big notch down. I figured it out later, they had closed the grand piano and stuffed the room with tables. Loses its charm for sure when you see tourists in multicolored dresses and crying babies. I'd rather they up the price and keep the atmosphere.
14274	79	5.0	1	2010-12-02	German sausage and mustard combinations make this cafe a warm, fancy way to eat German street/comfort food. The coffee, hot chocolate, and strudel shine as well. Hard to find because the Neue museum has a TINY sign and looks like any other apartment building. Use a gps if you're not a local.
14275	79	5.0	1	2010-11-23	"5000 people have told me to go to this place, so when I finally got to the Neue Galerie this weekend and saw that there was a long line to get in, I didn't want to give up right away.  I asked one of the security guards in the lobby and he said it looked like a 40-minute line.  He also said that the crowd eased up at 2:30.  So... I went through the museum exhibits (which are amazing -- look for reviews under ""Neue Galerie""), went back to the line (which, just as the guard had predicted, had shortened considerably), and still waited 15 minutes. What did I get for my patience?  A trip to Vienna. This place has come very, very close to reproducing a Viennese café-restaurant with all the typical ""Schmankerln"".  Even down to bringing the coffee on a silver (colored) tray with a glass of water, which every self-respecting Viennese establishment would do.  Even down to placing the (paper) napkins ON THE PLATE with your cake/Torte/strudel. The coffee was very good (duh).  The pastries, described by others before me, are fantastic. Dark paneling; a fireplace; large windows facing 5th Avenue.  Just what you'd expect a café in an Austrian museum that used to be the home of a young Vanderbilt to look like. Worth the wait?  That's a personal question.  For me, yes -- but now I can finally say ""yes"" when people ask me if I've been, and that's a relief all by itself. If you DON'T like the idea of a wait, and don't need a view of 5th Ave., just go downstairs to Café Fledermaus, which serves the same food, same pastries, same coffees as upstairs, without any wait at all. I would have done this myself, but they're closed on Mondays..."
14276	79	4.0	1	2010-11-18	This review is only for afternoon coffee & desserts.  A bit of Austria/German right smack in the heart of the museum mile.  Great before/after the Met.    Dark, refined, calming interior.    Excellent coffee.   Elderberry water was refreshing.    Knocked off a star for the desserts, which were good, but not stellar.
14277	79	4.0	1	2010-10-19	Great little gem to eat along Museum Mile if you're tired of hot dog vendors. I recommend their sachertorte and linzertorte, but their hot chocolate tastes like it was made out of Swiss Miss (bad!) with homemade whipped cream (good!). I wouldn't go here all the time for fear of wearing out the novelty, but it's a cute place that's worth checking into once in a while.
14278	79	3.0	1	2010-10-14	My mother and I decided to go out for a ladies' lunch today. We chose Cafe Sabarsky based on it's highly-rated desserts, great reputation and a convenient location. We shared 2 salads and had cappuccinos and a piece of cake for dessert. The salads were presented simply, but elegantly. Everything tasted quite good, but to be honest, for the cost, they were pretty tiny portions. We asked for a basket of bread, which helped to turn our appetizer sized salads into a more complete meal. The bread was wonderful, and without it, we would have been left hungry. (which, after a $50 lunch seems a bit unforgivable) The beets with pines nuts and goat cheese were just that. No bed of lettuce to bulk things up. The cheese was of wonderful quality, but again, not much of it. The crab meat salad included a few slices  of radish and cucumber and half an avocado. The crab was light and delicious, but doused in too much mayo. The basil vinaigrette was wonderful and I wouldn't have turned down a bottle to go home with- but they didn't sell it. The best part, without question, was the chocolate apricot cake with fresh whipped cream. The waiter told us that was the most popular choice on the (very appealing) dessert menu and that made a difficult decision much easier. It was not dense and heavy- although it looked that way. It had a decedent chocolate ganache layer on top, but underneath was a relatively light chocolate cake. The apricot was almost undetectable...but once every few bites I would get a little aftertaste of it- very nice. The homemade whipped cream on the side hit the spot. The setting is pretty casual but comfortable. Make sure you sit facing the windows for the best vantage point. Overall, I'd totally suggest stopping in for a coffee drink and some dessert, but skip the overpriced, under portioned lunch.b
14279	79	5.0	1	2010-10-02	Cafe Sabarsky is a beautiful restaurant with dark paneling located inside Neue Galerie, a 5 minute walk from the Met. My parents and I ordered: Weisswurst mit Brezen & Handelmaier's - (Bavarian Sausage with warm Pretzel and Handelmaier's Mustard) The sausage was a little too bland for my tastes, but my mom loved it. The Handelmaier's mustard was sweet and chunky and perfectly complimented the soft pretzel. Kasekrainer mit Sauerkraut & Rostkartoffeln - (Smoked Bratwurst stuffed with Cheddar Cheese served with Riesling Sauerkraut, Roasted Potatoes and Dijon) The bratwurst was a little too salty. The dijon mustard...OMG. It was honestly the best mustard I have ever had. I'm usually not a fan of mustard, but WOW. Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut & Rostkartoffeln - (Roasted Sausage with Riesling Sauerkraut, Roasted Potatoes & Dijon) Similar to Goldilocks and the three bears, this was the sausage that was just right! Perfectly delicious and just the right amount of flavor. All three were juicy and let out that beautiful popping sound when our knives cut through the casing. Make sure to try: Holunderbeerensaft (Fresh Elderberry Syrup with Sparkling Water). It's a rich purple colored drink that is so subtly sweet and refreshing. Apfelstrudel (Apple Strudel)! Oh boy, oh boy! It's dusted with powdered sugar, served with whipped cream on the side, and guaranteed to make you drool. Lastly, you MUSTMUSTMUST try one of their Viennese coffee specialties. We got the Kaiser Melange (Fresh-ground Coffee with Whipped Cream). The presentation was amazing. The coffee was served on a silver tray with a glass of water topped with a small spoon. The perfect end.   Why do I live on the other side of the country? :(
14280	79	4.0	1	2010-09-26	I'm a huge fan of palatschinken.  There needs to be more of it.  Funny thing is, I wasted months of not eating palatschinken back when I was living over yonder because I thought it was some kind of pork dish (Schinken = pork in German).  D'oh!  Nope.  It's a crepe.  Wonderful, delicious crepe-a-palooza.  So, in the effort to make up for lost time, I abide by the maxim, always get the palatschinken.   Cafe Sabarsky's got a trout palatschinken. It's good.  Yes, it's a bit on the small side.  Sabarsky is nothing if not authentically European, meaning, kind of expensive, kind of small portions, etc.  But no one will bat an eye if you get wine at lunch. So that's a good trade off.  And then you can order cake.  And coffee.  And as long as you ignore the damage being done to your wallet, it's all good.  There are far more mediocre places in New York for the same price.  I mean, have you seen how much the Olive Garden charges these days?  Well, I haven't, but whenever I'm in the midwest and end up at those chain places, I'm always surprised that they are not actually so cheap.  At least the Cafe Sabarsky is charming and good.   Sabarsky's Sacher Torte is more Demel-y than Sacher-y. Sorry. I will elaborate, borrowing an explanation from a friend of mine.  In her words, Sacher Tortes are like day old Ding Dongs.  And that, my friends, is why there's Schlag on the side. Because Austrian cakes are dry.  Now, Demel's Sacher Tortes have always been slightly moister than Sacher's Sacher. And Sabarsky seems to have borrowed the Demel recipe (although the chocolate is not as rich).  In other words, the Sabarsky Sacher Torte is kind of like a half-a-day old Ding Dong.  It's still good, though.  But, honestly, not as good as Demel's, whose branch here closed a few months ago. I'm still very sad about that. Oh, as an aside, many reviews complain that the cakes here are on the dry side.  Willkommen in Österreich!  Seriously.  Austrian cakes tend toward the dry side.  Sabarksy's very authentic on that front. As an aside, if what you're interested in is Austrian food, and you're not beholden to the UES location or proximity to the Met, may I suggest you head downtown to Cafe Katja?  The spaetzle's better.  It's cozy and has a great wine list, and it's much cheaper.  Just a suggestion.
14281	79	3.0	1	2010-09-08	Enjoyed the decor  - dark paneled wood,crystal chandelier,classical music playing in the background.I felt like a monied doyenne from Fifth Avenue being served by attentive waiters..Yes there is alot of schlag on the menu but how can you not like that? Great sausage, crab salad and of course the desserts and coffee.
14282	79	5.0	1	2010-09-05	I have to congratulate this establishment on authentic food and decor. The cakes and marzipan reminded me of Gerbeaud Patisserie in Budapest. I had the Elderflower drink (Holunderbleuten) as did other reviewers and enjoyed the unique taste. The Rehruecken, a cake made with marzipan, was fantastic. The classic Sachertorte (dark chocolate cake with apricot marmalade) was well executed.
14283	79	4.0	1	2010-09-04	This is a wonderful place to sit with someone special and enjoy a good cup of coffee. The atmosphere is elegant, spacious and yet cozy as well. The wait staff is pleasant and attentive but give you plenty of space to enjoy your company for as long as you like.
14284	79	4.0	1	2010-08-22	"Coming here the day after a mild bout of food poisoning is not the wisest decision I've ever made, but reasoning is not my strong suit when the smell of Bratwurst is in the air. My friends and I all got the same thing: Viennese hot cocoa and the Bratwurst with potatoes and mustard. While we waited for our food we took in the opulent setting. It's all dark wood paneling and crystal light fixtures and the room is littered with tiny tables and booths shoved up against the wall. I think I even had a non-celebrity sighting here and saw one of the artists from that Bravo Project-Runway-knockoff-art-show. There was also a very adorable waiter that I kept having awkward eye contact with. He had very blonde hair and an innocent looking face so my table thusly dubbed him ""sexy hitler youth boy,"" which may or may not be appropriate to write here, but whatever. The cocoa? Delicious! It was cocoa for adults for sure, not too sweet, very strongly cocoa-y, and pungent in a great way. After we'd finished eating a little girl at a nearby table had a cup of it delivered to her and she had to mellow it out with some of her water because it was too rough on her baby palate. This is yet another reason not to like kids. The Brats came and when I cut into mine for the first time I thought I heard angels sing. These were natural casings and they had that ""pop"" that only good old fashioned intestines impart. The meat inside had perfect texture and spice that was only made better with some of their killer mustard. This was seriously the best mustard of my life. I ate it on it's own until tears came to my eyes because it was so strong, which was a small price to pay for such condiment greatness. The bread that came in the little basket was also tasty, but I hope I didn't offend them by adding salt on top of the unsalted butter that they provided. Unsalted butter makes me really sad. They didn't rush us out at all either, which was nice on the back end of our meal, but we had to wait a while to get a table. I get that it's a fancy place and they don't want to rush you and that it's supposed to be a little cafe where you can hang out and all, but when you've got a line 12 people deep, maybe you can speed it up a little. I'd still go back and wait all over again, though. Unlike the German members of my family, this food was warm, pleasant, and very classy."
14285	79	4.0	1	2010-07-26	This place is just a fun place to go for lunch or a late afternoon snack.  The food is very good, but the desserts are wonderful. My wife and some of my friends had the type of very rich desserts which the Viennese are justly famous for.  As I have to be a little careful, I had the apfel strudel, which was also wonderful.  If you plan to come for lunch, you should check to make sure the museum is also open that day, as they have a very good collection of early 20th century Austrian art, especially the paintings by Gustav Klimt.
14286	79	4.0	1	2010-06-17	My first time here... I'm still waiting to pay the bill, but I have to say wow! Easily the best spatzle I have ever had, though I have not yet been to Germany. The goulash melts in your mouth, the dessert is divine and the waiters are very nice. I only had to wait about 15 minutes to get my food once I ordered. I was also seated quickly. Only con was that I had to ask for a water refill myself, as the waiters, once you had your food and drink, left you to enjoy it in peace. Which, is fine except they didn't just bring new water either. So, 4 stars.
14287	79	3.0	1	2010-06-01	In New York's vast mix of ethnic food German food has somehow gotten rather lost. Sure there are a few places that boast German specialities but they are sadly nothing more than ridiculous caricatures of true German dishes. Schnitzel and sauerkraut are not the ONLY thing we Germans like to eat. Thus I had high hopes for Cafe Sabarsky, knowing that it is in the Neue Gallerie, I was sure that there would be some real Germans working there. While I found the cafe to be elegantly decorated, and the menu was pleasantly written in both German and English, I was not uber impressed. Everything was sort of just OK. You know that feeling when you don't really remember too much of a dining experience because everything is sort of one note? The only thing that stood out was the coffee which was good and strong and tasted just like my Grandmother's but for $6 a cup with no refills I'll stick with my downtown caffeine spots. The real highlight about Cafe Sabarsky is how calm the atmosphere is. Its really like you've left New York for the afternoon and are in some small German town.
14288	79	5.0	1	2010-05-24	The experience of this cafe, located in the The experience of the lovely cafe, located in the Neue Galerie, is wholly exquisite!  I had a delcious soda (elderberry syrup in sparkling water) and linzertorte, and fantastic does not describe how satisfying this delightful repast was as a little something at eleven o'clock.  The room itself is noteworthy in its beauty, and I would have happily spent more time surrounded by the dark wood paneled walls and elegant atmosphere here at Cafe Sabarsky.
14289	79	4.0	1	2010-05-09	I went to the downstairs restaurant called Feldermaus which shares the same menu as Cafe Sabarsky but not the same decor.  Even so, it felt very Euro except for the Latin American waiters.  It was nice to hear French speakers at the table next to me and English accents at another. I had a glass of Elderflower Spritzer (Holunderbleuten) which was very nice but a bit too sweet for my palate.  For lunch I had the frisee salad with bacon and hard boiled (but runny yolk) egg.  I love a perfectly cooked egg.  It came with a healthy serving of good bread.  It was all very very good.   The service was professional and swift if a bit cold and stand off-ish.   It wasnt cheap though.  $17 w/o tip for a light lunch.  But, it was in Manhattan.  And it was close to the Met where I had gathered a good appetite after looking at all the ancient and medieval artifacts. The desserts looked really good but I obstained.  Which I kind of regret now.
14290	79	4.0	1	2010-04-10	"Want to be transported away from the bustle of Manhattan and into the calm, Old World splendor of a European cafe?  This is the spot. While technically Viennese, the decor and atmosphere could put you in Madrid, Rome, or Berlin, with expertly strong coffee drinks served on silver trays, and half-liter glass bottles of coca-cola.   Most people come here for coffee (great but expensive) or fancy pastries (great but expensive), but I think the best time to come is in the mornings (they open at 9), when the place is half-full and mostly occupied by Europeans looking for a reminder of home.  Their breakfast combos are a great deal, such as the Wiener Frübstück, where for $13 you get a Viennese-style cappucino, a glass of fresh orange juice, a perfect soft-boiled egg, two slices of eggcelent brioche toast, a side-order of umlaut, and a generous basket of breads to be topped with salted butter, and Austrian honey and strawberry preserves.  The scrambled eggs with potatoes and perfect bacon ($9) is light-years beyond what your corner diner will prepare. And don't be scared as you wrench open the huge wrought iron doors into the Neue Galerie and are confronted by a polite but imposing security guard.  Just say ""I'm here for the café"" and he will show you the way."
14291	79	5.0	1	2010-02-21	This is one of my very favorite hidden gems on UES & a great respite from snowy afternoons in Central Park! the double dark chocolate cake is sure winner & true Viennese treat.
14292	79	4.0	1	2010-02-11	Wow what a find!  It can be hard to find a reasonable place on Museum Mile.  This little Viennese cafe is hidden in the Neue Museum Lobby.  You can go to the cafe without going to the museum.  Great coffees with whipped cream, pastries, gluhwein, Spatzle, other viennese specialties.  Perfect for a rainy day lunch, catch up with friend, and museum.  Dare I  say the cafe was better than the museum collection?
14293	79	5.0	1	2010-01-16	Try apple strudel with hot chocolate. They are great.
14294	79	5.0	1	2010-01-12	We waited in line for about 20 minutes around 1:30 to be led into this beautiful room, European and bustling like an old painting. My friends had the coffee with whipped cream and the shot of water on a silver platter. The waiter denied any methodology for the water -- it's just the way they do it. The trout in crepes was great, the cabbage salad with walnuts crunchy and finely seasoned. I had spaetzle with peas, mushroom and so forth, a great thing to eat when it's winter and you're starving. My other friend had an egg on toast sandwich and they are real foodies who were completely pleased. The apfelstreudel was perfect -- fresh, a wholesome apple taste without chemicals, crisp crust, perfect unsweetened whipped cream. I almost think it would be a great place to go after a quick visit to the museum or an outing all in itself. There was almost never an empty table, and some just came for the desserts which were wonderful to sit by. I felt like a kid in a novel. A beautiful novel!
14295	79	5.0	1	2009-12-29	The perfect late-afternoon experience after a visit to the Met just a few blocks away. Austrian culture makes me nervous as a general rule but I gave into it this time & am glad I did. We shared two German-style appetizers--very tasty. And the coffee was perfect: double expresso with unsweetened whipped cream. Elegant room. Worth waiting in line for a bit.
14296	79	4.0	1	2009-12-21	Great place to stop after an afternoon of museum hopping.  Two coffees and two cakes came to $30 and I didn't mind at all.  The cakes were luscious - the chocolate deep with a tinge of apricot, the fruit tart light and sweet and with a little crumble on top.  Everything came with home made whipped cream (including my coffee!) and it was nice to sit and relax for a few minutes before tackling the Neue Gallerie.  We'll be back.
14297	79	5.0	1	2009-11-08	If I lived in New York, i think Cafe Sabarsky would be my ultimate date place. Located inside the Neue gallery and across from central park, it's the perfect place to stop in for a pastry and coffee especially if you've spent a day at the Guggenheim or the MET, though it seemed like most people were there for lunch when I went. The dark wooden decor and the European looking waiters definitely add to the atmosphere (It's a Viennese cafe). Split the linzertorte and sachertorte with friends. Definitely preferred the sachertorte but both were good. The coffee is strong and delicious. Felt like I was in Europe but with better customer service!! :) i am a fan.
6435	79	3.0	1	2009-10-25	A wonderful little cafe, with wooden floors, high windows looking towards Central Park, and nice marble round tables. This is a good place to meet a friend you haven't seen in a long time if you want to sit down and chat over a nice hot chocolate, excellent coffee, and a slice of sacher torte. A great place to take friends or family that are visiting after a full day at the Met and Guggenheim. Just beware that during peak time you may have to wait a bit to be seated. I stopped by Cafe' Sabarsky a couple of times, once after visiting the wonderful Neue Galerie, another time during the museum mile festival. I came here last night with a friend after a visit to the Guggenheim, and for the first time I had the opportunity to try some of their food, rather than just the desserts. For drinks I had the Ayinger Bräu Weisse beer ($6.5), which  I really enjoyed. I then ordered the Bratwurst Mit Sauerkraut & Röstkartoffeln ($14; roasted sausage with riesling sauerkraut & roasted potatoes and Dijon), which was a bit disappointing: the sausage was a bit bland, not crunchy on the outside the way I like it, and the riesling sauerkraut a bit too soggy. So perhaps it is better to stick to the desserts and coffee selection...
14298	79	5.0	1	2009-10-25	My mom came to visit NYC and I brought here to this classy joint on the UES to check out the great Viennese coffee. The security for the museum/cafe was very courteous when you walk in and they thank you when you depart. Dining and having great coffee in an UES mansion facing 5th Avenue is a great experience. Attentive service in a classy unpretentious atmosphere is how it should be when dining and having coffee/deserts. The coffee here is fantastic along with the rich but delicious cakes. Portions are small for certain items, such as O.J. I'm guessing it may be Euro-sized portions. After eating, you can go upstairs and visit the museum's Austrian German artwork, including the fabled Klimt painting of Adele Bloch-Bauer along with countless other rare finds.
14299	79	4.0	1	2009-10-20	I've been here for their Viennese coffee and desserts (which I somehow paired with sausage), but would recommend it even more for a low-key - if someplace this expensive can still be low-key - breakfast. The cafe is housed in the German-Austrian art museum Neue Galerie. The building was originally Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt III's 5th Ave mansion, so it's got that going for it. The decor at the Cafe is gorgeous. Get there early, hang up your coat, grab a newspaper from the selection arranged on the piano to your left and take your time enjoying the very small portions you will soon be served. I went for the Wiener Fruhstuck, which was a Viennese coffee, orange juice and little glass of chilled water (served on mini silver platter!), a soft-boiled egg in an old-fashioned egg cup, a nice assortment of breads and brioche, jam, honey etc. $13. Someday I might splurge and go for the Sabarsky Fruhstuck  upgrade ($21), just so I can get my two soft-boiled eggs served in an unnecessarily large cocktail glass, and a little ham. At 5th Ave and 86th Street, it's a nice starting point for a lazy Sunday of Museum Strolling and Park Sitting.
14300	79	3.0	1	2009-10-05	Great place for coffee and dessert! We went there yesterday. I had espresso with hot cream and a cheesecake and my boyfriend had beer with sausages. Everything was great! I wanted to try other desserts too but decided that I'll do it next time Place is little bit noisy and we had to wait  in line for about 5-10 minutes. Waitresses were really nice. Location is great-all the museums around you. I highly recommend it.
14301	79	5.0	1	2009-08-26	Enter a cafe in Vienna without the airfare. Bratwurst, salads, soups, scrumptious desserts, espresso, wine, idyllic atmosphere.  After a delicious European meal, visit the Neue Galerie. Get your Austrian on!
14302	79	4.0	1	2009-07-15	Charming place.The chilled chocolate milk with vanilla ice cream is a perfect summertime beverage. It's usually served with whipped cream. But I passed on that addition. You have to draw the line somewhere. Then have a slice of their marvelous dark Viennese chocolate cake and mull on the great divide.
14303	79	2.0	1	2009-07-08	The room is beautiful. The food is mediocre. The portions are small. The prices are large. The upper east side formula for the ladies who lunch. Can't they at least get some real sausages, not some typical, pumped full of chemicals, supermarket brand.
14304	79	4.0	1	2009-06-17	I love both the food and the place.  The portions are small, which allows you to save some room for dessert.  Klimt torte, Sachertorte, Apfelstrudel... hmmm. Great coffee too!  My husband and I went again today.  He had smoked trout with pancakes.  It was supertasty!  I had an avocado, tomato and crab-salad. Yummy!  I've never been disappointed by anything I've had here.  Happy Birthday to me.
14305	79	4.0	1	2009-05-17	Usually most people come to Neue Gallery to enjoy the German/Austrian art masterpieces but I came here with a different intent: To check out how good their Sachertorte(A pastry with two layers of a slightly bitter chocolate cake with a puree of apricot jam connecting them, and completely covered in a shiny dark chocolate glaze) is. If I had more time I would love to see the works of Klimt, Schiele, Nolde, Klee, etc., but I only had an hour so my priority was obvious -  enjoy the infamous Viennese confectionery masterpiece! Jaaaaa! I got lucky and was seated promptly without waiting (4pm on Saturday). I already knew what I wanted, so I ordered a cup of Espresso and Sachertorte. Then came my Sachertorte served in a traditionalist style with a dollop of schlagober(whipped cream), looking very luscious! Voila my ultimate delectable layered chocolate cake!! Although I personally prefer the Sachertorte I had in Japan which was richer and more flavorful, it was still delicious. Espresso was good, by the way. Since it's a Viennese cafe, the coffee better be good, right?  I'm going to try the real Sachertorte at Hotel Sacher this summer!
14306	79	3.0	1	2009-05-14	"It was around 1 PM on Wednesday. There were two older ladies in the line before us. They didn't look tourists but Austrian American(?). The room wasn't full (see the photo). We were seated to a table for two in the middle of the room. Older UES Japanese ladies with their demure attires were chatting behind us.  The room was mostly full with European tourists having coffee, cake and for some with a bottle of water. I think we ordered too many foods for the small table. See the photos. Rote Beete Salat Mit Ziegenkäse beet salad with goat cheese, pine nuts and sherry vinaigrette - This was the best of all the choices we had today. The cube cut beets were inside the big red cabbage leaf like a red flower. Two kind of dressings (green & red) were drizzled and completed the art. David Y. said in his review. ""It was beautifully presented"" Although it was beautiful but missing goat cheese was bummer. I found out when I was writing this review. I imagined how this salad looked if there was some white in the plate.....It would be perfect! Matjesfilet Mit Ei Und Apfel matjes Herring with egg spread and apple - It's an open sandwich. The chewy bread was cut thin. The herring that was marinated in sweet-vinegar over powered the egg spread that I forgot about even it was there. I am not a fan of sweet marinated fish. The sliced red onion helped to cut the fishy taste. The small touch of dill placed nicely on the red onion completed the small size sandwiches. It came with salad but there was no dressing. There was a green sauce in a small square dish but I was told it's for ""pot au feux"". Kavalierspitz Mit Röstkartoffeln Und Cremespinat Austrian Beef ""pot au feux"" with oven roasted potatoes & creamed spinat - This was also beautifully done. Half cut white and green asparagus and stick cuts of carrot were sprinkling over sliced beef with jus and finished with placing a small mountain of grated white horseradish. This was clean and not heavy dish. The side potato and spinach sauce was unmemorable. Sachertorte Classic Viennese dark chocolate cake with house made apricot confiture - Light and unsweet created sophistication. There was no confiture instead there was whipped cream..... Apfelstrudel Apple strudel - ""The strudel was delicious! The apples were perfectly tart and the pastry was yummy and crispy"" Corinne M. said and I experience the same. I enjoyed with the schlag (whipped cream). It smoothed the strudel. Kaffee Fresh-ground coffee - It came on an oval shaped sliver-like try. There was a tiny cup for milk, small glace for water. The coffee was very smooth. I enjoyed. Cafe Sabarsky showed me their food is clean in flavor and taste. The less seasoned dishes shined its ingredients. I know why I don't eat here much. I tend to like everything salty.... I stick to Kaffee with dessert."
14307	79	3.0	1	2009-05-13	Came here this afternoon for Kaffee & Kuchen having been to the Met. we'd spent a few days in Vienna earlier in the year and fancied a more European treat than the usual american fare to be had everywhere. The Sabarskytorte and the Rehrücken were let-downs, but the coconut/almond/fruit cake was tasty. The Einspänner didn't have enough whipped cream (nor was the cream rich enough) and the espresso was more like strong coffee...it's more an american version of an Einspänner than something authentic. Verdict - not bad, but really a pale imitation of excellent Viennese pastries and coffee (I'd had an Einspänner and a piece of Sabarskytorte at Demel, Vienna).
7430	79	3.0	1	2009-04-01	"Cafe Sabarsky is located inside the ""Neue Gallery"" which has a strong collection of German and Austrian art including works by Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, and Paul Klee. The cafe is decorated in period objects, which presents a very traditional and classic Austrian ambiance. Kurt Gutenbrunner, head chief and co-owner of the Neue Galerie New York brings the Fin de Siecle Viennese culture to NYC with authentic Viennese specialties and traditional pastries with a wide selection of Austrian and German wines, beers, coffees, and teas. In the evenings (6-9pm) every Thursday night from October through May, Cafe Sabarsky holds live cabaret performances devoted primarily to German and Austrian music of the 1890's to 1930's. The live cabaret is preceded by a three course prix-fixe dinner ($110 includes performance & dinner). I came to Cafe Sabarsky with a party of five for mid-afternoon tea and had to wait over 25 minutes. This places draws a crowd and they don't take reservations, so waiting is almost unavoidable. They do offer a slimed downed version of the cafe with a more modern ""grab and go"" environment downstairs that does not require as long as a wait, but the menu is limited and the setting is no different than your average NYC cafe. If possible, I would recommend wait for the real deal. Definitely a great place to unwind and have a cup of tea or coffee. Their food is only satisfactory and often take a long time to prepare, but their desserts is a must try. Come for breakfast, brunch, tea, or dinner; you get what you pay for and most are not disappointed."
14308	79	4.0	1	2009-03-29	I pity the fool who doesn't order the Apple Strudel!
14309	79	2.0	1	2009-03-27	Came early in the AM before camping out at Mile 24 of the Marathon.   Desserts looked amazing on the counter but it was too early for me.  Service was polite and efficient, but to be honest, the coffee/breakfast was unremarkable.  If I happened to be back, I would make a point to order one of the desserts.
7868	79	3.0	1	2009-02-26	On a Saturday morning at 9am, before going up to volunteer at NY Road Runners, the squab and I tried brunch out at Neue Gallerie's Austrian cafe: Cafe Sabarsky.  We were the first ones there and weren't even sure if their doors would be open. We split the Sabarsky Frustuck, which was comprised of a small (yes, small) glass of Orange Juice (fresh though), breads, ham (nothing special, just ham), boiled eggs, and a Euro-sized coffee.  All that much of nothing for $21.  Ouch.  It wasn't event that great tasting. We also had a slice of their chocolate cake.  Nothing special to report here as well.
14310	79	3.0	1	2009-02-25	We stopped by for an early breakfast and were surprised to be the first patrons in the restaurant!  A couple other tables filtered in, but when we left a tad before ten, there were only two other parties seated. I shared the Sabarsky Frustuck, which has a bunch of stuff: coffee, oj, boiled eggs, breads, ham...  It was good, but nothing a-a-amazing.  And it was $21!  We tried one of the desserts too: a chocolate cake with apricots, and it was also good but also nothing special.  Portions are TINY.  The glass of oj was seriously like, three ounces.
14311	79	4.0	1	2009-02-15	Ausgezeichnet! sums up Kurt Gutenbrunner's charming Austrian kaffeehaus in the UES Neue Galerie.  Based on the fin de siecle (end of the 19th century) kaffehaus, the menu serves up authentic Viennese specialties and traditional pastries.  The kind English and Deutsch-speaking server helped steer me towards their signature dishes.  The Gulaschsuppe mit Kartoffeln (Goulash Soup with Potatoes) and the Spätzle (Fresh Herbed Quark Spätzle) pleased my taste buds as well as the Rote Beete Salat mit Ziegenkäse, Pinienkernen und Sherry - Vinaigrette (Beet Salad with Goat Cheese, Pine Nuts and Sherry Vinaigrette), which was beautifully presented.  Although the mustard added a zing, the Weisswurst mit Kartoffelsalat (Bavarian Sausage with Potato Salad) was not as memorable.  The pastries looked divine on the back table, particularly the Apfelstrudel (Apple strudel) making a return visit a must. $$
11217	79	2.0	1	2009-02-03	Went for Sunday Brunch for my 25th Birthday and was disappointed.  Waited 15 minutes to be seated which was expected, but I thought the payoff would be better.  I had the smoked trout which was fine, and my mother had the veinerschnitzel which was tasty but i could have made it. Prices are high for what you get.  The desserts are not good, and i was actually made.  We had the dark choclate cake and the linzer  torte, along with hot chocolate.  The hot chocolate was not rich like expected, it has a bitter taste.  When I eat desserts I want them to be fantastic, and these were definately diner level if not worse.
14312	79	5.0	1	2009-01-31	as someone who has lived in vienna and other regions of austria, let me tell you, this is as authentic as it gets...right down to Der Spiegel mounted on wooden sticks! i love love love all their pastries...they really get them right. sometimes there's a line during the lunch rush, but it's worth it.
14313	79	3.0	1	2009-01-10	the atmosphere was similar to cafes in vienna, but it wasnt anything special. i ordered the apfelstrudel, which was amazing, but a little pricey. i also ordered some grunertee, which i liked. the person with me ordered heiss schokolade and marzipan cake, very dissapointing....i cant say if the hot chocolate was similar to that in vienna bc i never had it there, but it was pretty tasteless and expensive. the marzipan cake was kind of dry, but it was ok.  its not something i would order anyways so i cant really say if it was good or bad really. i liked the place because it reminded me of my time living in austria, i saw that someone ordered some almdudler, that is awesome that they have it! i used to drink it all the time when i was there, i will get it next time i go.
14314	79	4.0	1	2009-01-02	I liked their savory better than their desserts. I had the crepes with smoked trout and the spaetzle with cream, corn, peas and mushrooms. Delicious. I also tried the goulash, and it was awesome. I loved all the savory dishes really. For dessert we had the chocolate rum cake and the caramel cake. Both were just ok.  Not great.  Not fabulous.  Just ok. I'd go back here again, but I'd definitely skip on dessert and have a hot chocolate instead.
9745	79	4.0	1	2008-12-31	had a great great lunch here with my parents.  frankly, it was by no means the best bratwurst or austrian desserts I've ever had, but this place is in new york, not vienna, so you have to set your expectations appropriately.  and what the food lacked marginally was more than made up for by the setting - what a great place to while away an afternoon.
14315	79	5.0	1	2008-12-23	This is a fantastic Austrian cafe! Their coffee and espresso drinks are amazing - there was a thick layer of crema on top of the coffee which was served on a little silver platter with a small glass of water, just as coffee should be. We stopped in just for a coffee, but were trapped by the deserts. I also had the bratwurst with riesling sauerkraut and potatoes which was one of the most amazing taste experiences I've had this year :) It's upscale and a little expensive, but absolutely worth it.
14316	79	3.0	1	2008-12-21	"Went here this evening after a few months of meaning to go. The food selection looks really good, and after some deliberation, my brother and I decided to try dinner another time and went the dessert and drink route. What we had: Apple Strudel, Marzipan Ring Cake, Green Tea and Hot Chocolate. I'm a Marzipan-aholic, so the ring cake was all my idea. My bro had spent a semester in Vienna a couple of years ago and hadn't had the chance to get Apple Strudel since, so that was a must order. The strudel was delicious! The apples were perfectly tart and the pastry was yummy and crispy. The ring cake was not something I would get again. It really didn't taste a lot like Marzipan and was really dry and generally boring. The tea was really good and the hot chocolate was okay. The ambiance was upscale and pretty and seemed to emulate a Viennese coffee house. We didn't have a chance to go into the Gallery but the Alfred Kubin drawings on exhibit are really cool: dark and nightmare fantasy. This is how the Neue Galerie describes the collection: ""Collectively they envision a world that is the opposite of that of modern science and technology: one that is driven by human irrationality, animal instincts and supernatural forces""."
14317	79	5.0	1	2008-11-24	A marvelous experience. I had a light meal, but thought the restaurant was beautiful. It is located in the Neue Galerie which houses a number of Klimt paintings and a number of German and Austrian exhibits. I suppose it was the combination of a delicious crepe and coffee in a wonderful setting that made me love it so.
14318	79	5.0	1	2008-11-09	What a unique gem!  The surroundings are impeccable, just a little bit fancy but in a very understated way.  The brunch is delicious, love the eggs+potatoes all cooked together and perfectly spiced.  Extra-credit for fantastic coffee drinks and you can NOT leave without trying a dessert!   This is the absolutely *perfect* place to go for a coffee and something sweet after a stroll through the Me, which is just across the street.  Do it !!
14319	79	5.0	1	2008-11-03	I love the Neue Gallerie -- but a lot of that love is due in part to Cafe Sabarsky. It's just like being in Europe - the furniture, the art, the atmosphere. It's all dark wood and blue walls and makes me feel like I'm in a Degas for some reason. And the line up of desserts! Sigh. I love the apple strudel and the opera cake. And I've never met a dessert at Cafe Sabarsky that I didn't like.
11209	79	4.0	1	2008-11-02	A grand luxurious cafe -- absolutely beautiful light fixtures and furniture, there's even a grand piano (which they use when they have concerts/cabaret). The atmosphere is incredibly authentic. The waitstaff is also authentic, they leave you alone -- which some people find dismissive or inattentive but I find completely refreshing... The dessert selection is phenomenal, and they're all spectacular -- I'm not usually a dessert person but for this place I make an exception... Most things are very reasonably priced, except for the coffee and hot chocolate ($11!) but the service is extremely elaborate and posh. Great sandwiches and soups, great selection of juices. I really like the food here, but the ambiance is what's really the selling point for me. A great excuse to spend a whole day in a beautiful setting (the wonderful Neue Galerie). I love this place.
14320	79	4.0	1	2008-10-08	Some come to the Neue Galerie for the German and Austrian art, from Klimt and Klee to Loos and the Bauhaus, but foodies in the know give the masterpieces a cursory glance then slip into Cafe Sabarsky, the musuem's homage to turn-of-the-century Vienniese cafes, where apple strudel, opera cake and brioche are works of art in their own right. The hot chocolate, served unsweetened on a silver tray, is a very grown-up indulgence, as is the elderflower soda. In addition to the sweets, there is a savory menu and as of late, my favorite has to be the spicy eggs with cornichons and paprika.
14321	79	4.0	1	2008-09-15	"I will have to remove one star for generally inattentive service, but four stars for everything else: food, presentation, ambiance, and dessert of course. My friend and I walked in to a very quiet cafe at around 11:45 AM, and were seated in a cushion-y corner that allowed us a view of the entire dining room (funny sites included a couple reading their separate newspapers together without talking.) I was hungry, so I went for the spaetzle with corn, mushrooms and peas. Super creamy and dastardly indulgent, it was about as Austrian as you can get, and left me feeling full but not sick. My friend went the lighter route with a sausage salad that vaguely resembled the shredded salads so popular in Japan. Due to the vinaigrette and abundance of peppers, onions and cucumbers, it was surprisingly refreshing. When walking in it is absolutely impossible to avoid ogling at the gorgeous table of Austrian cakes lining the mirrored wall; naturally, ordering was in order. My friend went with Rehrueken, which in my studies it is said to resemble a rack of venison with marzipan and almonds sticking out to appear as garlic. Regardless, it was a delicious cake, which is saying something considering I usually avoid plain chocolate cakes at all costs; orange confiture made it even better. My Mozart Tarte was one of the best, I guess you could say ""classic"" desserts I've had in a long time. Consisting of layers of pistachio, marzipan, and chocolate in various forms, it was a true delight in both color (a vivid green/brownish-black) and taste. A word to the wise: you can be as casual as you wish."
14322	79	2.0	1	2008-08-09	"Too foo foo and too expen$ive for my taste, great for chicks to hang out and ""have coffee""   Not good for kids or groups - just small tables - sorry Sabarsky.   The food was good - it is close to the park."
14323	79	5.0	1	2008-08-06	This place is not only beautiful... but a dessert heaven as well.  This is just too much goodness in one location!  If I lived in NY I would be here all the time... okay, at least once a week.  I had espresso with whipped cream on top.  The table next to us had a plate of whipped cream delivered to them!  (Don't ask me why... it's still pretty awesome though.) Oh, Cafe Sabarsky... I'm going to dream of you tonight.
14324	79	4.0	1	2008-05-28	This is the perfect place to get coffee with a friend from out of town. Cafe Sabarsky has great desserts, but their lunch entrees are overpriced. Their coffee is too bitter, in my opinion, but they're famous for they're wood-paneled dining room and location in the Neue Gallery rather than their food.
14325	79	5.0	1	2008-05-21	SACHER TORTE!!! I really do not need to say *anything* else.  All you need to know is right there in big, obnoxious capital letters.
14326	79	5.0	1	2008-05-05	As much as I love the Cafe Sabarsky, and as fiercely as I maintain that their coffee is the best in New York, I would still have to give the regular fare here something like a 3.5 ( I like best the pea soup, sausages, liverwurst sandwiches, and the spaetzle.) Also, having finally succeeded in sampling everything on the pastry list, I can say the cakes can be little uneven: the Mohnguglhupf (poppy seed bundt cake) is sometimes dry, and the Linzertorte and the Mozarttorte are heavy and too sweet, whereas the Schwarzwlder Kirschtorte, Schokolade Feuillete, and the brand new Marie Therese torte are the best of the best. But it is not the regular fare that I wish to review.  Instead, I want to talk about the gorgeous prix-fixe dinner that comes as part of the cabaret evenings the museum puts on.  I've been twice, and both times the dinner was on a different level than Cafe Sabarsky food usually is.  The first time I had white fish with crispy breading over a bed of lentils, and the second time beef topped with onions and wine sauce and dreamy, buttery mashed potatoes.  The menu has three courses, so you'll have a choice of some sort of delicious, creamy soup to start or beautifully dressed salad, and then a selection of really excellent desserts like vanilla-citrus palatschinken or molten chocolate-hazelnut cake.  It's a less-well known Cafe menu that I wanted to make everyone aware of!
14327	79	4.0	1	2008-03-30	I came here with a friend of mine for lunch. The wait was about 15 minutes or so; it was like everyone was in the know about this joint. It was a nice surprise. A live piano player, relatively open space and very cute decor. The waiters were pleasant and not intrusive. The food was very well prepared, if small. I thought that the servings were a little on the small side, but were tasty. We had the bratwurst, the scallops, the crab salad and a couple of sweets to boot. It was about $90 for the two of us with drinks included, so a little on the pricey side. But it is very relaxing and a great place to have a relaxing lunch. A definite keeper.
14328	79	5.0	1	2008-03-21	While it's true that the pastries here are the best of their (Viennese) kind and the lunch is good, I think of it as a well-kept breakfast secret! You see, if you go early, there are no lines, no wait for food - in fact, you'll have few neighbors and can have as leisurely a meal as you like.  The menu is limited but very appealing; I've had the mixed-bread basket (served with delicious Austrian preserves that, fyi, can be found at Schaller and Weber in Yorktown); the not-too-sweet yeasted coffee bread; and, my favorite, scrambled eggs with potatoes, served with 2 slices of thick bacon.  Portions are small and prices are high, but everything is so beautifully presented and prepared that you don't feel unsatisfied.  (And yes, all of these dishes have German names that I'm not attempting here!) Bonus: if you eat breakfast and decide to visit the musem, you can bypass the lines. Bonus 2: One of the waiters has a dueling scar on his cheek.
14329	79	5.0	1	2008-03-15	I can't believe that I never wrote a review for the Cafe.  I worked at the museum awhile back.  So got to spend more time here than most. There are certain places and time that become events or moments.  Drinking a coffee at the cafe, when it's raining or snowing and looking out at Fifth Ave for me will be a moment. Not to mention, they serve an excellent Kaiser Melange.  Medium bodied but isn't flat and bland, it has tones of nuts and well, it's topped with whipped cream.  Awesome. Awesome desserts.  Apple strudel and topfentorte were my favorites.  Light and just sweet enough.
14330	79	5.0	1	2008-03-06	Gruss Gott! On my honeymoon I went to Vienna at Christmas, which was lovely, though we both got sick and I was so sick that I was hallucinating (it had nothing to do with Vienna, just, you know, people get sick on their honeymoons). Anyway, Vienna is a fabulous city. Often forgotten by Americans who think Austria is Australia spelled incorrectly, Vienna was--of course--the center of SE Europe for quite a long time and the city still projects it's regal opinion of itself quite distinctly. I love Vienna, however, one of the problems with America is that no one else does and you can never find anything that approximates it. EXCEPT FOR CAFE SABARSKY. Going here was like stepping right back into Cafe Demel, or the Hotel Sacher. It's almost eerie how similar it is once you pass through the doors. The vibe, the decor and, best of all, the food. The food is really pretty amazing. It's just like Vienna (or at least as close as you can get with American ingredients, which is pretty close). The whole range of foods are very good. I love having breakfast there and I love the schlag (whipped cream), but most of all I love that you can go there, get anything and really forget that you aren't about to walk out onto the Ringstrasse. It's really one of my favorites I've been to in the U.S.A. By the way, yes, you do have to wait... I don't see how it makes it a bad restaurant though. It's an amazing place and has high demand, hence the wait. I tried to go at off peak times and usually sauntered in without a stop.
14331	79	5.0	1	2008-02-10	This is a great place to stop after a stroll through Central Park.  Have a coffee and apple streudel...yum!!! Or if you looking for a meal...the food is all good.  It is usually crowded though and you may have to join the line outside...but it is worth it.  The atmosphere is nice...wood line walls....like a cafe in Europe....Recommend!
14332	79	5.0	1	2008-01-16	An excellent place to have a relaxing, delicious meal between exhibits anywhere on Museum Mile.  Eating at Sabarsky isn't cheap, but is as much of a treat as I've ever had.
14333	79	5.0	1	2007-12-02	"Where can you get any better cakes and desserts than in a ""Wiener Kaffeehaus"" (Viennese Coffeeshop). Sabarsky's pastry come as close as it can get to the legendary places Demel, Central or Sacher in Vienna. If you are not coming for the sweets, their austrian dishes are excellent, fresh and very authentic. The wine selection maybe pricy, but you certainly get very good ones. Overall, a sure hit, never been a miss so far. And by the way, if you want to read Austria's trashiest daily newspaper, they have the ""Kronenzeitung"" and the ""Standard"". Na bitte, a Melange.."
14334	79	4.0	1	2007-10-22	on a sunday morning brunchtime, after a week's worth of grueling cardio workouts at the equinox in preparation for my jaunt to barcelona and ibiza, i felt my jeans getting a bit loose, and i figured i'd avoid having to purchase a whole new wardrobe for my slightly svelte-r self, and instead gorged on pastries at this little viennese gem inside the neue galerie museum. the apple tart was delish! as was the monstrosity of a hot chocolate and the breakfast basket of various breads and jams.  i left feeling stuffed into my newly slim fitting jeans.  loved the mozart playing in the background. classical music does wonders for a hangover! risk: emerge like an overstuffed strudel reward: better hangover cure than most uppers
14335	79	5.0	1	2007-07-23	If you can't afford the flight to Vienna, enjoy your plate full of (and I mean FULL of) goulash with yummy spatzle right in Manhattan. When you walk in it looks just like a real Viennese coffeehouse but without all the goddamn cigarette smoke. They serve coffee Viennese style, on a plate with a little glass of water. My baby got the bratwurst and it. was. divine. Classic wurst served with rye and mustard. God it was good. I would drive in from Boston for the wurst alone. It is the one thing I craved for months after visiting Vienna. (mmmm ... sausage stands ... mmmm ... Kasekrainer at two in the morning) And the gallery was free that day, so I also was happy to be dining Austria style after seeing Schiele.
14336	79	4.0	1	2007-05-08	Perfect way to unwind after a day of walking and hard core museum-ing. At the cafe, you'll find a young, hip (who else can get away with with a white suit and black shirt) pianist playing Chopin waltzes and Mozart sonatas while you sip your coffee. The dessert were fantastic. I highly recommend the Mozarttorte... it has a nice surprising texture.
14337	79	5.0	1	2007-03-07	My most favorite place to go for brunch. Usually there is a long line outside but its worth it. Especially now with Adele there its been a mess getting a table. (If you dont know what I'm talking about then perhaps this place isnt for you.) When you sit in the tiny room you really feel like your back in Vienna. The sandwichs are my favorite.   Maybe if you're lucky they will seat you in the far corner table where Estee Lauder used to sit.
14338	79	4.0	1	2007-01-27	I need more levels; 4 stars seems a little high, but whatever!  The number ratings on here tend to be fairly useless anyways, I might as well continue to contribute to that. Cafe Sabarsky is located inside the Neue Galerie on the Upper East Side, just a few blocks from the Met or the Guggenheim.  It doesn't feel like your average museum cafeteria, though - honestly, it seems like it would be more at home in the village or somewhere else downtown than up there.  That's a good thing, though - museum cafeterias tend to be bad, and Cafe Sabarsky was actually pretty good. The first thing I noticed was the wait.  We got there at around 4 pm - hardly prime time for eating - and yet it was packed and we had to wait 15 minutes (maybe 20) for seats.  When they do seat you, it's like a european-style cafe, with small round tables, a fireplace, a piano, the little espresso bar thing in the back, bottles on the mantles, etc.  Think one of the little coffee shop/ cafes in the village, and you'll have a decent idea of it. The difference, of course, is that it's a real restaurant in a museum on the upper east side, so they actually have real food.  Moreover, as it's in a German/Austrian museum, the food is also German and Austrian.  (I'll confess that I don't necessarily know which dishes would count as each; I've eaten in German places and Austrian places and they seem pretty close to me.) The food was good, a little pricey, but what can you expect for a museum restaurant?  My friend ordered a pear juice, and it was in a bottle that was, I believe, literally 3 ounces.  Maybe 2.  They poured it into what looked like a shot glass, and all of that would've been ok if it hadn't cost $3.  I shared a half-bottle of wine with the other member of our little party and we probably paid less per ounce for the wine than the juice.  (Not that the wine was cheap; $26 is a good price for a bottle but a little much for a half-bottle.) The dishes range from $8 or 9 for the smaller dishes to $25-30 for the largest dishes.  They have sandwiches and salads but the best looking dishes were the actual real entrees - $15-25, mostly.  One person got sausages with sauerkraut cooked in a riesling sauce, another the squash soup and a salad, and I got the scallops and asparagus. All of the meals were good.  The salad was bland but the soup was excellent; both the sausage and scallop dishes were good but not great. Overall, I enojyed it and I'd go back if I was in the neighborhood visiting the local museums.  The biggest problem was probably the wait - if it was 20 minutes at 4 pm, I can't imagine what it must be at 1 or 6. (I also noticed that they sell some take-home goods there as well; jars of preserves and bags of hot chocolate mix and other similar things.  No idea if they were any good, I didn't bother picking any up.)
14339	79	4.0	1	2006-11-05	You say Palatschinken, I say Palacsinta -- Let's call the whole thing off.  On second thought, let's not.  While the sweet [Hungarian] palacsinta (crepe) my mother used to make was filled with cheese and raisins and served as dessert, the palatschinken I had last night at Cafe Sabarsky was served as an appetizer and filled with smoked trout in a horseradish sauce, topped with creme freche.  It was simply delectable. Their Hungarian beef goulash with fresh herbed Spatzle was very tasty and reminiscent of home cooking, but the meat was surprisingly tough and should have been stewed much longer so it would just fall apart with your fork.  The goulash was redeemed by the apple strudel.
12958	79	5.0	1	2006-11-04	An old world coffee house serving one of the best cups of coffee in New York! Your $5 cup of coffee (that's right, coffee - not cappuccino or latte) will arrive in a silver tray with a spoon placed atop a glass of water - much like they did in the old Kaffeehauses. The coffee is excellent - strong, much like a double espresso. Enjoy it with the traditional desserts and pastries of Vienna: Sacher Torte, Apfelstrudel, Topfontorte (Pear Cheese cake) and Klimttorte - chocolate butter cream and hazelnut ganache. I've loved the Sacher Torte -  chocolate cake with a tart apricot filling and semi-sweet ganache topping. Stop by after a visit to The Met. I've always had a great time in the afternoons and early evenings as I am not a fan of the crowds that can pack the place around lunch.
12859	79	4.0	1	2006-04-30	Some what off-the-beaten tourist track this cafe is special for it's uniquely German/Austrian feel. Traditional desserts and pastries are available (the Sachertorte was great) and they make a mean espresso. The ambiance made me feel like I was in Europe cerca 1915. There was a 15 minute wait on Saturday afternoon...
14340	79	4.0	1	2006-01-18	apple streudel to die for....I didn't even know I like apple struedel before I came here!!!!  The food is good german, as well...you will have to wait if you go on the weekend...or else arrive at 11:30.  Vegetarians....a few options.  Fishiterians, I reccommend the smoked salmon sandwich.
14341	79	3.0	1	2006-01-12	Never visit a museum cafe weekend lunch hour. Besides the hour long wait, the food is so so, but the peach cheesecake and the chocolate hazelnut desserts were worth the wait. Very helpful waitstaff...
14342	3839	1.0	-1	2013-04-06	Wont ever take another step into this place ever again. Over expensive menu for very little. You will be leaving hungry. I went through the weirdest interview with an arrogant GM and once I stepped into this place I knew he would never hire me a Native American this place is not diversified. From reading the horrible reviews I would say you Mr. GM dont know food, wine and what your patrons want!
14343	3839	1.0	-1	2011-03-28	The atmosphere is wonderful and, judging by what the other diners were eating, I think the food is probably quite good.. Unfortunately, the service was so slow that we had to leave before our entrees arrived so we could make our show at the Annenberg. We allowed an hour and 15 minutes after we arrived and told our server that, but she was so busy chatting up other tables that she took a half hour to get our order in. If a first course, terrific bread and good wine had been a sufficient meal, we'd recommend it highly.
14344	3839	1.0	-1	2010-07-01	"I'm  sad to give the new iteration of White Dog one star, as it used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia. With a renowned veggie-friendly, sustainable menu, it was a stand-by in West Philly, if a bit over-priced. Their menu, although somewhat static, was fully of variety.  I also really used to appreciate the service, which was solicitous without being pushy. On my last visit, I was very disappointed with the service, pricing, and food. Disclaimers: this was an off-time (late Wednesday afternoon), so I haven't seen the new dinner menu. White Dog's lunch menu seems to have changed to fancy bar food--quesadillas, burgers, ""gourmet hot dogs"" (?) , and only a few veggie options. For a lunch menu, it was quite overpriced ($13 for a small tofu sandwich, $11 for a quesadilla that included only three small slices). And that's where the bad service began. My partner and I--both people who dine out quite a bit and are used to surprises, gaped when the quesadilla arrived. It was that small. When he asked if that was the standard lunch portion, the waitress asked, ""Anything else I can get you today?"" and flounced away. She didn't seem to realize that we had voiced a critique. That was the moment for her offer him salad, fries on the house, or at least to go to her manager to mention there was a complaint. The food wasn't even particularly good. I wish I didn't have to be so harsh, as I've had some truly memorable, lovely meals at White Dog. However, they won't be getting my business again."
14345	3839	1.0	-1	2010-05-03	"It takes a lot for me to give a business a one star rating. I used to love this restaurant, and was excited to stop in after a few years for a Sunday brunch with a friend. To be fair, we didn't even experience the food (from what I remember, it used to be pretty tasty), because the service while we were waiting to be seated was a study in ineptitude. We went around 2 pm, and the restaurant was pretty empty, both inside and at the outside dining area. Despite this, my friend and I waited for 20 minutes while the hostess stood behind the desk, chatting on the phone... or staring vacantly into the waiting area. We asked her twice during this time if we could put our names in, and she responded ""just a moment"". Oooookay. FINALLY another employee came to the reception area and asked if we were being helped. We had high hopes when he said he would go set up a table for us immediately; however, after ANOTHER 20 minutes, we decided to head to another restaurant. I certainly don't mind waiting if there seems to be a reason for it, but the only thing this fiasco proved to me is that the staff is completely incompetent. This used to be a great place, but I'm sorry to say that I will not be going back here."
14346	3839	1.0	-1	2010-04-08	The White Dog used to be one of my favorate watering holes, but the new management has ruined its ambiance.  The prices have doubled, the informality has dropped away, and it now has little distinction from any of a number of overpriced restaurants in Philadelphia.   The story below broke the camel's back, leading me to no longer frequent the establisment, and to cease all departmental luncheons or dinners at the dog. An important editor had come to visit me and we decided to go for lunch at the White Dog.  We appeared five minutes before lunch opening time and were told we could not come in the building.  We then asked if we could sit at one of the outside iron tables until they opened, but were told we could not even do this.  The rudeness was embarrassing, so the editor and I went elsewhere for lunch.  I have told friends about this incident and a number have commented on the unwelcome change in atmosphere and attitude that has overtaken the White Dog.  I will no longer recommend this restaurant to anyone.
14347	3839	1.0	-1	2010-04-08	Today was the first time I'd been to the White Dog since the new management and menus arrived.  I will not be going back. I ate at the bar, and had two appetizers with friends: the hummus ($7) and the grilled portobello salad with parmesan shavings ($13).  The hummus which I'd had under the old management was yummy and rich--- this hummus was so incredibly bland that if you'd given it to me blindfolded I'd have absolutely no clue what it was. I had to salt it to get anything out of it.  And, to make matters worse, the portion was smaller than it used to be.  The salad, while tasty enough, was so incredibly chincy: Maybe half a grilled mushroom cap, very little parmesan (and not very good parmesan), and very light on the greens.  I remember how I used to get a caesar salad for $7 and find it very filling--- now, for double the price, I had half as much food.  And I have to say, I find the new bar food menu bizarre-- half of it is hot dogs, which is just the cheapest, weirdest idea ever.  I am so disappointed, and will not ever return.
14348	3839	1.0	-1	2010-01-24	We went for brunch today and it was one of the worst dining experiences in years. Seated in the small room with us was an extended family with a toddler and a baby. The baby didn't stop crying and the parents changed the toddler's diaper twice -- once on the floor and the other time on a seat (had to be a health code violation). When we complained to our waiter and to the manager, the response was disinterest. They did not offer to move us or to compensate us as many other restaurants would have done in this situation. I will NEVER go back to the White Dog.
14349	3839	1.0	-1	2009-10-11	Enjoyed the Native American dinner every Fall and 2009 New Year's Eve celebration,  casual dinners and Judy's special program dinners.  Spur of the moment lunches on Saturdays were a treat.   We even hopped on the buses and joined in on political protests she organized.   We're not happy about  the changes by new owners.   We used to gladly pay the prices and go round and round the block for a parking space  to enjoy delicious local, organic, White Dog  food and their local beers but no more. My favorite food was their fabulous beef, any form ...steaks or hamburgers..even though the one I had recently was much smaller and didn't taste quite the same.   (Thought the regular chef was off that day.) The truth.......according to writer Daniel Denvir,  they're no longer buying their beef from local, organic Chester or Lancaster County people as before. Close your eyes.  What do you hear?  A TV in the bar blaring news and sports announcements?   With that addition, White Dog has the same ambiance as any neighborhood taproom or sports bar.   Blah hamburgers, shouting heads on walls....White Dog isn't special anymore.    Yikes!
14350	3839	2.0	-1	2014-11-16	"Solid beer list and great atmosphere, sub par food experience. We were there in the evening of 11/14 (party of 2) and sat at the bar. Asked the bartender about the 'roast turkey sandwich' and he described it as ""thanksgiving leftover sandwich"". 10 minutes later they brought me an open-face roll with 3 slices of cold cut turkey with some bacon bits, stuffing and a few arugula leaves. Not sure if they had run out of roast turkey that evening and he didn't know or if they celebrate thanksgiving with cold cuts but this sandwich was worse than any pre-made $5.99 sandwich in a grocery store's deli section i've ever had and it cost $15.  It was served with parmesan garlic fries, which were decent. We were going to a movie nearby and didn't have the time to return the falsely advertised item and order something else and were starving. the other food item we ordered were chicken wings and they were of below average quality. I would not recommend eating there."
14351	3839	2.0	-1	2013-05-06	Over priced for portion sizes.  Food was okay- we left a seafood place up the street for our niece who is a vegan.
14352	3839	2.0	-1	2013-04-19	"Wayne location. I had heard good things about this place - fresh locally grown food, vegan options, gluten free etc. I was disappointed and hungry when I left. I ordered the swordfish special for $29. It was a small boring piece of fish with a portion of fat. It was a pretty display but nothing for the palate. 2 cooked grape tomatoes, several raw mini squash, 2 cut halves of some orange root vegetable (can't imagine what; too hard to eat), one tiny cut roasted potato, about 1 Tsp carrot/parsnip puree (tasty), some green stringy garnish (like limp spinach or broccoli rabe). On the good side, nice atmosphere, adequate though not friendly service, good parking, ""main line"" clientele.  Maybe a good place for drinks. Expensive. Delicious roll and butter which I had to ask them not to take away....good thing as I would have left even hungrier. I will try it for lunch sometime."
14353	3839	2.0	-1	2012-09-29	We did not receive a warm welcome upon arrival. Small, expensive, crappy plates that were so salty it was difficult to choke down. Never again.
14354	3839	2.0	-1	2010-06-05	Used to love this place. And seems to be a hot spot if you are near Penn. But I've been twice this past year and both times I was very disappointed. The first time was Valentine's Day so I chalked it up to the pre-set menu. But then I was in Philly for a family event and we went to brunch here and  once again the food was below par. Plus, the first time they didn't tell us it was a price fixed menu when we made the reservation and the second time they didn't tell us when we (the first people in my group to arrive) sat down that the brunch was ending soon. So by the time everyone got there, we were surprised to at that point be told that we could now only order from one of the two menus they originally gave us.
14355	3839	2.0	-1	2009-12-15	The atmosphere has declined since the sale of this restaurant (there is now a TV in the bar!), and so has the food.  It looks quite decorative when it arrives on the rectangular white plates that many restaurants have recently adopted, but it doesn't taste very good.  I should have known when the server described dishes that contained many many ingredients--as if each additional ingredient increased the probability that the food would taste good.  It doesn't.  Since the White Dog has a nearly captive audience in university city, I sure hope that it is inspired to improve its food.
14356	3839	2.0	-1	2009-07-02	"2.5 stars because The food is good in the rare times I have eaten here, but the service is complete bullshit. There is no such thing as a ""quick bite"" at the bar. Trust me. I've tried.  I have never spent under an hour in here. Like last night, for instance. Two hours for 2 appetizer-size caesar salads, a mushroom soup and some warm pita and hummus. Two hours. TWO!!$*&(@#^$)&*@#^. If I have hours upon hours upon hours to kill, I'll make the trip. Maybe. But the service makes my blood boil. Ruins the experience... Sorry."
14357	3839	3.0	-1	2014-01-21	Nice place but the décor's a bit dingy.  Definitely needs an update or at least clean walls!  I really don't like sitting at a table where I can see dried milk splatters.  The food was good, but not stellar.  Decided to go here after seeing it listed on the Farm to Philly site.  I really wanted to eat at a restaurant that supports local, family farms and organic agriculture.  I went for lunch ordering the winter citrus salad and Spicy Lamb Bolognese.  The salad was a bit disappointing.  I couldn't find very much fennel.  It was mostly baby arugula and some of those leaves were wilted.  People--Salads need to be vibrant and salad leaves should stand at attention with crispness!  It tasted okay and the blood orange segments were a nice touch.  The lamb Bolognese was delicious, hearty meat sauce with a generous dollop of herbed ricotta and Parmesan cheese.  Pasta was cooked al dente, just as I like it.  I was stuffed so didn't have dessert or coffee.  I would order regular burger fare or sandwiches next time.
14358	3839	3.0	-1	2012-11-20	I've always thought of this as a great place however, they changed their bar menu and it is not as good or as satisfying as what they had before. Their hummus was sub par and the selection does not due for someone with an appetite. I got there after lunch and before dinner so the bar menu was all that was available which used to be okay but no longer is. I had the salmon sliders but they were just okay, nothing to write home about. Our waitress was great though. If I go back, I would not go in their in between hours if I am hungry. I debated between 3 and 2 stars but I figure their Lunch and Dinner menus are probably still really good.
14359	3839	3.0	-1	2012-10-25	a decent place to grab a beer and casual lunch or dinner. the burgers are very good and come with very nicely done side of fries. many of the other menu options are decent as well, but nothing spectacular. this place has a typical pub feel to it and it's great to just hang out with some friends and chat or watch the game. probably good that it doesn't have much competition in university city or otherwise i might have rated it lower. would go back if convenient, but wouldnt go back specifically FOR this place
14360	3839	3.0	-1	2012-08-06	Food:  O.k. to good.  The dishes looked amazing and sounded amazing, but the chef used a bit too much oil and salt. Arctic Char was probably the best of the entrees. Service: Uneven - our waitress was outstanding, but our wine server and hostess were inattentive and/or uncaring.   Wine:  Variety, pricing and service were all awful.  Among the worst I've experienced.  Our wine was served warm and the only person who cared was the waitress who took care of it.  Even then, it took a good 20 minutes to get a replacement bottle because they clearly were storing their wines in a place that warmed them up and they had to cool them off.  When the wine list is this unimaginative and overpriced, the least you can do is store the wines correctly!  Seriously - White Dog needs some serious wine consulting or they need to become a BYO.
14361	3839	4.0	-1	2014-10-03	Wonderful restaurant. The decor is very inviting, and the staff are warm yet professional. Some of the menu items are a bit off the map, but White Dog Cafe's choices are healthy by origination, and the plating and presenation is very attractive. I had the scrumptious Cajun Crusted Catfish, which is prepared perfectly, and has an incredible spanish chorizo finish. I recommend this restaurant for anyone who enjoys a comfortable fine dining experience.
14362	3839	4.0	-1	2013-09-10	Dining outside at the White Dog Café was a perfect pre-fall evening in Phila.  We took advantage of the Happy Hour drinks and dining menu which allowed for additional courses.  One Sauvignon Blanc and craft beer delivered ( my comment that the beer was more hoppy tasting than I had expected was met with an offer to bring me another variety. Even though I refused they brought me a small glass of Sly Fox Oktoberfest which was delicious) we started with the Beet Salad, Brussels Sprouts and Bacon and Chickpea Fritters.  The salad was crisp, chilled and creamy with chevre curds dotting the beets, micro greens and melon cubes.  The Brussels sprouts were buttery and sweet as if brown sugar had been added, with lardons of bacon. Chickpea fritters were so creamy and nicely browned with a minimal mayonnaise based sauce.  Dinner brought the Mussels with corn, scallions and chorizo in a broth that required a straw so as not to miss one drop.  Redolent with smoky flavor. The Tofu entrée was really tasty with the tofu encrusted and then sautéed. Micro carrots and some other root vegetable were sitting upon a puree of yam. A disturbance at another at another table caught our attention and gossipy us enquired of our server what the problem had been.  The customers being obviously out of line, we sympathized with the staff.  And that merited a thank you of a complimentary glass of Champagne each. This is a restaurant that still delivers the goods with regard to excellent service and food.  And obviously customer service is preeminent because those unruly customers were given everything they demanded . .. with a smile.
6033	3839	4.0	-1	2013-04-27	This is a great restaurant. I have been here several times and have never been disappointed by the food. Although it is on the pricier side, their food is always delicious and special. On brunch days, you can order unlimited bloody mary's for only $8 and unlimited mimosas for $12 (i think). One of the only drawbacks is that the waiters can be slow at times and the restaurant sometimes smells a little musty (since the building is quite old). Nonetheless I would definitely recommend this 'old charm' restaurant if you are passing through the area!
14363	3839	4.0	-1	2012-09-24	The White Dog Cafe is quite good! Some colleagues and I went here when we were in Philadelphia for business, and I feel it was a good choice. A little pricy, but not bad. You get what you pay for in this case, because the ingredients are quality. While the menu may seem a little pretentious, it's ok, because it is really quite delicious. You can tell they take their food seriously here, and it shows on the plate. Also the servers were knowledgeable but not as snooty as you get in some locavore type places. They have a cheese menu that changes out often. I would suggest getting the 5-cheese plate so you can try one of everything. Their cheesemonger really knows what he is doing! It's not an everyday sort of place, but for a fancy night out, it is worth it. Two thumbs up from me!
14364	3839	4.0	-1	2012-08-28	We were dropping our freshman off at PENN and staying at a nearby hotel. This restaurant came recommended by a foodie friend. Well i have good news and not so good  news. First the not so good. Service was a bit too relaxed, we were there late and only a few other tables were occupied. The Greeting by our waitress was slow even to ask for drink order. She brought water to the table at room temperature, i had to ask her to please get us cold water. My wife's first wine came also un-chilled. Our main course took too long to arrive, and when i ordered a second glass of wine with the arrival of our main course, the wine took so long to get my wife popped up to track down the waitress. Now the good news. Food was excellent. Starter Bib Salad was so fresh and tasty. i got the heirloom tomato salad. We actually combined the two salads into one tasty tasty tasty treat. Loved the spicy yogurt sauce that came with the tomatoes. The main course was the scallops with corn mushrooms and candied bacon.... really tasty and a good size portion My wife and son shared the Hamburger which was tasty and done to perfection. They also got the Mac and cheese, now this was my favorite dish of the night rich and creamy full of flavor. This place is worth a try, creative and fresh food, nice atmosphere, just hope you get more attentive service. I would recommend this restaurant
14365	3839	4.0	-1	2012-07-29	Went here after visiting Upenn and really enjoyed the atmosphere! Very close to the Sheraton and bookstore. The food took a little while to come but was well worth the wait (Weight lol)! Thanks WD
14366	3839	4.0	-1	2012-05-27	I have always been a fan of local sourcing and I have been a fan of White Dog even longer, so I was prepared for a good meal at White Dog. I was recently a guest at a friend's post opening dinner and I was taken both by the bar service, the wait service and the food. The bartender was exceptionally gracious and capable -- four complicated bar requests -- and the dinner service in the private dining room - was both gracious and competent.   The principal server could not have been more gracious, well informed, or efficient. The specials were presented thoughtfully and were sold well.  The product, a catfish with just a little chorizo, which more than 60% of us ordered was delicious -- fresh, exceptionally well prepared and presented. The dessert I ordered, a meyer lemon cheesecake with a blood orange gelee, was delicious but not quite as memorable. I will be back.
14367	3839	4.0	-1	2012-02-10	One of the better brunches I've ever had.  Wonderful service and high quality ingredients. *Note*: I've only been there for brunch, and school wasn't in session.  YMMV.
14368	3839	4.0	-1	2012-02-07	Great food, friendly service, cozy atmosphere. Recommended.
14369	3839	4.0	-1	2011-04-11	On a trip to Philly to visit colleges, we were lucky enough to stumble upon this café.  The interior is so special that it should become a landmark destination for anyone visiting Philadelphia.  Three historic buildings have been combined into one restaurant through an addition at the back.  Each room is unique; one is like a boxcar with a long green velvet banquette and a piano.  Windows divide the room, each having its own curtains.  The theme is dogs, and the walls are lined with vintage plates and paintings of every kind of dog you can think of.  Not just the cliché' dogs at the poker table.  There are two bars which we returned to for a drink later that evening.  We really liked the brunch menu.  My husband and I had the chicken salad sandwich made with cherries.  Yum!  It was served with a nice mixed green salad.  My daughter had the crab quiche.  The people at the table next to us shared five different breakfast plates and they too looked delicious! What I like best is that the White Dog Café serves only local food brought in from within a 50 mile radius.  That means it's fresh, fresh, fresh!  Everything is sustainably harvested, and raised without hormones and antibiotics.   We will always go back.
11460	3839	4.0	-1	2011-01-27	I try to eat organic/local/seasonal and this is a great restaurant to eat this way!  It's super cute restaurant on Penn's campus.  They have a pretty large selection of artisan/local beers and organic wines.  Food is consistently good.  I especially like the roasted beet salad.  The tartars are all excellent as well.  Although a little on the pricey side, you know that it's because of the ingredients and not for trendy atmosphere
14370	3839	4.0	-1	2010-03-17	"I've never splurged for dinner at White Dog, but the lunch is fabulous. The ingredients are all fresh and assembled well. My sandwich had a side of greens with dijon vinaigrette that was amazing. The portabello sandwich was tasty with wonderful whole-grain bread. A companion said that the lamb bolognese was good, but a bit spicy even though the waitress had the spice ""toned down."" The only disappointment was dessert. The waitress recommended the doughnuts, but they were quite dull."
14371	3839	4.0	-1	2010-01-07	"my partner and I LOVE THIS PLACE. The food is so good, and while they are on the verge of having New York prices....whatever. We know it's fresh and comes from somewhere good. I also love that they reliably have vegan options. The waiters are great, and I love the atmosphere. I also appreciate that the bathrooms are labeled ""Democrats"" and ""Republicans."" ---my one negative comment is that the facility is not wheelchair accessible. As a liberal and progressive establishment, they should make more of an effort to make sure that White Dog is accessible to all."
14372	3839	4.0	-1	2009-02-17	great organic living and food, i bow to the owner.. Ive had many great lunches here.. quick easy and timely. I'm on this block alot and would pick this as my #1.5 stars based on the food.  3 based on the cocky waiter and bartender.  4 is the average.  If all you care about is food then go.... its high quality.  Expensive but high quality.  Great beer selection too.  A bit pricey for my likes.. but worth it.... you can taste that the kitchen cares about what they are doing, the food is fresh... go here! you'll love it and will keep coming back for more... i like sitting outside in the summer you can actually look into the kitchen from outside and see your food being made.... its like they are saying, we have nothing to hide, come take a peek... all dressed in white and working clean... you can trust them when like many restaurants you don't know whats behind the swinging door
14373	3839	5.0	-1	2015-01-01	This is one of those restaurants you must visit if you are in Philly. Went there for dinner and I was blown away, being celiac I was very happy that they were very knowledgeable of the disease and provided me with a menu that showed what was safe for me to eat. On top of it yes they brought me home made gluten free bread. Did I mention that the food was all organic?
14374	3839	5.0	-1	2014-11-16	I came without a reservation with two college girls.  They fit us in, gave us the best service, our waiter was wonderful  and the decor was outstanding.  And our food was delicious, incredible and left me wanting to come back again and again. I love this place and hope to have a reason to go back.  I recommend it to everyone!  It was amazing!
14375	3839	5.0	-1	2014-03-31	The food is delicious.
14376	3839	5.0	-1	2013-10-12	Every time my parents visit me we eat out somewhere and they're not easy to please. White Dog is probably their all time favorite! We had the best dinner ever and they were so happy. Excellent service, excellent food, excellent everything. Perfect!
14377	3839	5.0	-1	2013-09-26	Had dinner and drinks with friends last Saturday night and it was perfect.  I had the prix fixe dinner with the wine pairings and I can't wait to go back for more.  Great ambiance, good service, and well priced.  Thanks, I know that I wrote a review 2 yrs ago about brunch that was less than flattering but this dinner was the complete opposite.
10763	3839	5.0	-1	2012-08-22	Had dinner at the White Dog Cafe last night and it was delicious.  I have been to the one on Sansom Street a bunch but finally was able to try the one in Wayne.  Oh my goodness!  Everything was amazing.  First off the setting is beautiful both inside and their outside seating.  Secondly the food was so so good.  Calamari, Trout, Scallops and wood grilled vegies.  Very good across the board!
14378	3839	5.0	-1	2012-03-15	Eat there every time I'm in Philly.  Great menu and service.
14379	3839	5.0	-1	2011-02-01	Really nice restaurant in such a cute street. Orange tofu totally blew me away!! Martini was also very good too!! I will def come back again!!
14380	3839	5.0	-1	2011-01-29	My favorite place to have breakfast with my boyfriend! The bread basket is to die for and everything is incredible. I never want to leave!
14381	3839	5.0	-1	2008-07-02	"White Dog Cafe is the most venerable of the University City eating establishments. It's tucked between the rowdiness and nostalgic kitsch of New Deck Tavern (an Irish bar) and the schizophrenia of Saturn Hair Club, purveyor of hairdos, lattes, and Vietnamese sandwiches (all quite decent, I've heard). Nothing says ""it's so good to catch up with you buddy ol' pal"" or ""yes - this is a date"" better than dinner in the main dining rooms of White Dog. The décor is a lesson in hominess: the wainscoting and beige walls, the photo frames paying homage to an extended canine family, and the dainty lamps whose shades emit the cozy yellow hue of dinnertime. Its warmness and intimacy is rare for a restaurant. It's easy to lose yourself in conversation, your thoughtfully prepared dishes, or a pitcher of Yuengling and forget that you're not in your dining room, or any other person's dining room for that much (it only takes a glance up at the dog portraits hanging everywhere to set off an eerie, Planet of the Apes alarm in one's head that humans have been supplanted in the course of earthly civilization.) Food at White Dog Cafe is tasty and elegant, without being fussy. I'm a fan of the chicken (excusez-moi, ""locally raised free-range hen"") and fish dishes. Whether roasted or seared or other, the method of preparation is usually just right, and the main show is usually complemented by fresh vegetables and fairly subtle sauces. It's hard to say whether free range this and organic that really make a difference other than tacking several dollars to the bill. However, many yuppies will be comforted to know that the dollars they jettison into the sustainable food ether via White Dog get recombobulated by cosmic forces (I hear Adam Smith's invisible hand pitches in sometimes), packed into sandbags, and distributed to third world farmers for use as animal feed, mulch, or an effective caulking agent when mixed with water.* The hungry diner is warned: upon leaving White Dog Cafe, you will probably feel compelled to drop by New Deck next door for an order of Awesome Cheese Fries. The portions at White Dog are not so small as to cause indignation, or French restaurant-esque cognitive dissonance (my two shrimp and sprig of parsley - they were out of this world man! The sauce, the sauce!), but the typical White Dog meal will land you somewhere just north of ""not-hungry"" and several steps short of ""sated."" This said, it'd be most wise to have the Dark Chocolate Chipotle Pot De Crème after your meal - still one of the best desserts I've had anywhere. Then there's the bar at White Dog Cafe - good for college students who can barely afford a $10 dinner but also a great place for you and your fellow chaps to knock back a few. The bar menu offers tasty bites - chief among them, the grass-fed beef burger (as a Californian, I vow it's better than In-n-Out) and the nachos with salsa, guacamole, beans, and cheese melted over - each under or around the $10 mark. The bar also offers a great selection of Pennsylvania beers and ales on draught and changes seasonally. By the power vested in me as a long time patron, though, I declare there is nothing sweeter in life than a pitcher of Yuengling and the nachos. Finding a seat in the bar area can be an issue when things get busy (Friday evenings especially). *All kidding aside, sustainable food is worth thinking about and I remember being rather inspired when the founder of White Dog came to speak about this issue at the dining hall when I was a freshman at Penn."
14382	3839	4.0	1	2015-01-03	Been here a couple times now, always with a larger party of about 8. I have been pleasantly surprised by the good, flavorful food, despite the relatively lower ratings. Everything I have gotten from the meat and cheese platters, to the leafy salads and fresh tomatoes, to the burgers and other entrees have been good. There is a nice selection of drinks, with some tasty seasonal flavors. The food is always good, but for a larger group, the service has always been slow. That's my only complaint. Otherwise white dog cafe is a pretty solid choice.
14383	3839	4.0	1	2015-01-03	We were at this restaurant on Dec 30th in town getting a second diagnosis at the Hospital of the University of PA.  We were very appreciative of the great service by Alicia and her great recommendations for lunch.  We both are salad entrees. I had the salmon and my dining companion had the shrimp.  Looking for a cozy place that won't rush you with good locally grown and well prepared food. The White Dog Cafe is my go to place in West Philly.
14384	3839	5.0	1	2014-12-28	My wife and I went for breakfast while we were in philly for a football game. The place was decorated amazing if you love your four legged friends. The paintings around the restaurant were awesome and would really like to get in touch with the artist actually. They said his name was jay Rodriguez bit no way to contact him. Oh yes, the food was fantastic as well. Would absolutely visit again.
14385	3839	5.0	1	2014-12-28	Farm to table organic fare.  If you love dogs you will love the ambiance and decor. Had brunch . Menu I'm told changes daily. Limited menu but very good choices.  Has a small Bar, outdoor  seating and pleasant fun atmosphere. Nice are to walk around after eating stroll.  Prices were reasonable for the city . Would love to go again .
14386	3839	4.0	1	2014-12-23	"Hadn't been here in years....not since Judy Wicks was there and the bathrooms were designated for ""setters"" and ""pointers."" We went for a post-work happy hour. Lots of food selections at discounted prices and a decent selection of $5 drinks. Our bartender was great, too...we left quite happy and it didn't break the bank."
14387	3839	5.0	1	2014-12-22	Speechless. Every piece of food that we tasted, smelled or saw was absolutely phenomenal. My only regret is that my stomach wasn't bigger. We arrived ravenously hungry and started with coffee and pear bellinis. At least they told us that it was coffee. That magical brown liquid could not be in the same food group as what you find at most coffee shops. We ordered the parmesan truffle fries and a side of brussel sprouts. My wife thought if I ate all of these starters, I would be too full to eat my main dish. She was so wrong. I had the stuffed french toast (stuffed with apple butter cream cheese and topped with  diced apples and cranberries with a creme anglaise) and my wife had the Lancaster omelette (minus the goat cheese). We picked off of each others plates and everything was mind blowing. We wish we knew the people sitting next to us so we could eat their food too, but that's rude so we didn't do it. Til next time WDC. We will return.
14388	3839	4.0	1	2014-12-18	good food and nice atmosphere.   it was super crowded when we were there (it was also the night before Philly marathon so a lot of people were in town), so it was hard to get the server's attention but still, he was nice about it. over all, good food with good service. recommend it.
14389	3839	4.0	1	2014-12-18	Amazing place for brunch in university city. They are really adamant about their farm to table menu and everything is very fresh. I went Saturday and had their special which was a steak sandwich with an overeasy egg, avocado and salsa. It was served with Parmesan truffle fries and both were awesome. Parking is hell, but that's to be expected. I definitely recommend.
14390	3839	5.0	1	2014-12-17	We went for breakfast on our first morning in Philadelphia and had the American breakfast with eggs sausage hash browns and one with pancakes the other toast . I had the White Dog Cafe special French toast but it was so sweet and sickly I was jealous of my husbands and daughters breakfast.Yes it was nice but we would not go out of the way to go again only of we were passing, but would not think twice about getting on a bus down Clark to go to Ellys White Dog Cafe for breakfast or lunch and Ellys will be the last place we go to before going home.
14391	3839	4.0	1	2014-12-14	Black bean burger wasn't too tasty. the Parmesan fries ! Amazing!! Good service. Awesome interior, surprises at every turn
14392	3839	4.0	1	2014-12-14	Great atmosphere for dining. Cozy with lots of dog related wall art. We had kale salad, mushroom soup and the braised pork shank. All were very good.
14393	3839	4.0	1	2014-12-12	My friends and I went for dinner on saturday. Everything I tasted was good, squash gnocchi, brussel sprouts, hummus plate, apple pie dessert. My entree was the chicken dish, it came with cheese dumplings. It was very good. As our very nice server Alicia put it everything is as organic and local as possible. Its a very cozy and relaxing restaurant with a lot of nice decor. I would definitely eat here again, however I feel like everything is about $5 more expensive then it ought to be. I am going to try the one in Wayne PA.
14394	3839	5.0	1	2014-12-10	Just had the Cheddar Burger with Truffle Fries. Amazing! Don't be afraid to get messy with it. The bacon aioli is really delicious and unique. I'd get this again in a heartbeat. We sat at the bar because the host told us we can get 10% off. At some of the places I've been to, that means you don't get the same quality of service as the tables so they give you a discount on the food. Not here. Our bartender Natalie provided spectacular service! She was very attentive and recommended great beers to go with our great food. I'm trying to dine more consciously - supporting the restaurants that source locally and humanely. So far, it's been pretty difficult to find but I'm so glad I stumbled on this place. Can't wait to come here again!
14395	3839	5.0	1	2014-12-07	Fourth/fifth time I've been - consistently great food, fantastic service & ability to accommodate changes in party size & food preferences.   Love this place - cute alcoves for bigger parties & really attentive to detail. Food is amazing...drinks are reasonably priced. Go. Period.
14396	3839	4.0	1	2014-12-06	We had been recommended this place so off we toddled and we were not disappointed. We asked to move tables as ours was next to a very cold outside wall, and this request was completed without any issue. Our dinners were tasty and the glass of beer interesting. All the food is sustainably sourced, and judging by our fellow diners the place is deservedly popular.
14397	3839	4.0	1	2014-12-05	Visited White Dog Café at 8:15 on Wednesday night. Charming atmosphere especially if you like dogs, and who doesn't! It was not what we expected which was a nice surprise. Several dining rooms made the café feel very cozy and welcoming. Nice touches everywhere. Menu appears limited on the selection. Waiter John assured my associate that pork was fall off the bone delicious. But when we ordered, no more pork! Ordered fish and ravioli. Fish was overcooked and was tough on one side almost like fish jerky. Black beans under the fish were COLD..brrr, The sauce on the fish was so slight but it was delicious. Maybe they ran out of the fish sauce too.Overall the atmosphere was better than the food. Yet the food was tasty even with the shortfalls. The pear bread pudding was so-so but the apple tart was perfecto. This restaurant is worth a try because its a fun vibe and I enjoyed just  walking around to see all the decorating that can be done when you have dogs as your theme. DOGS WILL BARK FOR THE WHITE DOG CAFE...
14398	3839	3.0	1	2014-11-19	I used to absolutely love White Dog when I was younger. The menu was so creative and unique, and the atmosphere was fantastic. But since it has been taken over from the original owner, and expanded, making the university city location bigger and adding the Wayne location, I think the service and quality has suffered. At brunch time on Sunday mornings, they seem to have more diners than their kitchen can handle, and so service is slow and the food frequently comes out cold. I understand that food needs to be made ahead of time to keep up with the high demand, but this doesn't mean that my eggs should be room temperature when they reach my table. The taste and inventiveness of the food is still there, but none of that mattered when your omelet is rubbery from sitting in the kitchen too long. The prices are as expected for a university city restaurant, and I would say that the quality of the food has the potential to live up to them, if only it were proper temperature and delivered in a more timely way. Also they seem to have a lot of turnover in wait staff, and don't seem to properly train their new hires. I've had water spilled on me every time I've eaten there this year.
14399	3839	4.0	1	2014-11-16	The food quality is very good and ingredients are fresh. The pumpkin soup and parafit were very good. We also ordered the egg in a hole and French toast and both were excellent. The Parmesan fries are out of this world and they are a must-to-order. I gave it only 4 stars because the service was a bit slow and somehow the nearby table got their food before us although they came 30 min after us.
14400	3839	5.0	1	2014-11-13	Great place! Staff is so friendly! Natalie the bartender is awesome and super nice. Had the veggie burger on the lunch menu and it was yummy! I will definitely be back!
14401	3839	5.0	1	2014-11-11	I can't speak to their dinner or lunch offerings, but I've been here for brunch several times and never been disappointed. The Lancaster county 3 Egg Omelet is hands down one of the best I've ever had, and I'm the type of guy whose eyes go right to the omelet selection on the brunch menu. The excellent $4 greyhounds and Bloody Mary's  bring it from 4 to 5 stars. I wouldn't go anywhere else in University City for brunch.
14402	3839	4.0	1	2014-11-09	"White Dog is nestled amongst some pretty notable establishments, including being across from Penn's Law campus (Federal Donuts next door, anyone?)  From the outside, the restaurant looks like a stone house and cozy even as the days/nights grow colder.  Making a reservation here - via OpenTable- is a must! So when we came here two weeks ago on a Saturday, we were looking forward to the organic menu.  As soon as we were seated in the upstairs dining room (my back towards the ""window"" facing the stairs), I noticed it could get a bit cramped if tables on either side were moved closer.  Second, White Dog makes creative use of its bathrooms with four individual doors with blow up pictures of dog faces on the front.  It's adorable!  However, be advised that space in the bathrooms are quite limited and you could be waiting a bit if all four are occupied. Onto the food:  The hummus is delicious.  A garlic/olive oil hummus strictly with pita bread unless you request vegetables, too (extra charge added to the bill).  My entree was the Maryland Crab linguine and the other was the chicken and dumplings.  We waited a little for our food, though, everything looked delicious when it was set on the table. The flavors in my dinner melded so well overall, though, the best way I can describe my plate is gently warmed.  I understand completely that vegetables lose nutrients after being exposed to a certain temperature, so I was not going to complain.  However, I can't say another diner would be so understanding.  For example, one of the people at the next table ordered the white bean ravioli and I don't think he expected what was brought out!  Honestly, it looked like it had been sitting out and what looked like spinach on top appeared severely soggy.  He did not touch it. On the other hand, I tried the chicken and dumplings.  Probably the juiciest chicken I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.  Again, though, the food was gently warmed.  Then, I tried part of a dumpling and unfortunately way too salty for my liking.   The overall quality of White Dog's food is present in the ingredients and how hard they work to source everything locally.  With that said, you will be paying upwards of the $20 range for certain dishes, especially the seafood.  The portions are moderate, yet enough if you want to take some home. The food is such that it leaves you with a satisfied feeling rather than heavy, which for me is a huge plus!   White Dog will win and lose some people, so I would recommend giving a second try.  In the near future I would do so and probably get won over with another entree and maybe even a dessert.  It's definitely a neighborhood spot and kept extremely well.  Give it a try!"
14403	3839	4.0	1	2014-11-09	"White Dog is that ""my parents are in town, let's go somewhere nice"" kind of place for Penn students, and it doesn't disappoint. I make it here maybe about once a year and it has evolved pretty dramatically over the years, becoming progressively more elegant and upscale each time I visit. When I was here last week, we were seated for the first time in the front dining room which was stylishly decorated in bright reds, deep purples, and enormous colorful dog portraits. The food has evolved as well, incorporating increasingly creative vegetarian and vegan main courses to their menu, which is a smart move for their farm-to-table concept. The last time I was here, I had a beautiful tofu dish that could have been home on the menu at Vedge, it was so elegant and delicious. This time, I stopped by here before an evening book discussion with my dad. We split their hummus plate to start, he got the vegan white bean ravioli with caramelized onions, carrot puree, braised turnips, and shaved radish and I ordered the grilled butternut squash with carrot BBQ sauce, roasted mushrooms, pickled chard, and crispy brussels sprouts. Gotta hand it to the chef- the menu is beautifully written! Every single dish, even the ones we didn't order, sounded complex and wonderful. The flavors were very good. The hummus is garlicky, smooth and delicious, with a variety of traditional pita bread and crunchy crisps for dipping. We were also provided an amuse bouche of carrot(?) puree over toasted crackers- oh man, was it good. My dad and I agreed we could eat an entire plate of them. My main was great, although too large to finish in one sitting. The butternut squash was plated like a steak, with the pickled chard, mushrooms, and brussels sprouts over top and the carrot BBQ sauce underneath. It was very good. I could have used more brussels sprouts and pickled chard and fewer mushrooms, but that is completely personal preference- I loved the bite of the pickled chard contrasted with the smooth sweetness of the barbecue squash. I stole a taste of the white bean ravioli and found it rich and flavorful as well. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, professional, and present just the right amount- not too much and not too little. I still love White Dog through all of its evolutions! Considering its elegant space and inventive menu, I think it's actually a bit underrated on Yelp. Should be more like 4-4.5 stars."
14404	3839	3.0	1	2014-11-03	Beautiful decor and nice ambiance. Also not very loud which is plus. Nothing amazing about the food though. I came for brunch. The menu was very limited.
14405	3839	3.0	1	2014-10-30	"Service: 4 stars, food: 3 stars, prices: can only get away with it because this place is situated right on penn campus. This is the kind of place that houses awkward business meetings (""milo...is that you?""), professors bitching about their students (""I just don't believe the students are engaged with our old curricula!"") and waspy lady lunches minus the vodka in the water glasses.  Honestly I can't quite tell the difference between the 3 restaurants on this block, except new deck is a little bit rowdier and an HH favorite, and baby blues you can smell around the block."
14406	3839	4.0	1	2014-10-29	PLEASE BE AWARE- White Dog is no longer doing the bottomless brunch drinks. However, my review is from prior to them getting rid of the special. The location is great, the décor is beautiful and the food was outstanding. Couple that with the bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary's and  it was almost perfect. Why not 5 stars - the place was beyond packed, we had reservations made well ahead of time as we were celebrating a birthday with a group of 12 people. We weren't sat until ONE HOUR after our reservation time and unfortunately we didn't get much of an apology or even acknowledgement from the hostess as to how late we were being sat. However, once we got to our table and got our drinks and food -  we were able to forget about the hour wait.  So disappointed they got rid of the bottomless drink special.  But if drink costs / specials aren't your concern - I highly recommend.
14407	3839	4.0	1	2014-10-27	We stopped in for dinner while in university city, remembering that my mother ate here years ago while attending a conference.  Ambiance is great from the bar to the dining areas.  We were dining late so we went right to the entrees.  My wife had the Hay Smoked Pork Tenderloin which was tender and delicious, well cooked but a little too smokey for her taste.  I had the Filet which was cooked perfectly and very flavorful.  The accompaniments were creative and tasty.  Everything was very fresh. The bread was delicious too.  Our server was very nice and made the experience all the better.
14408	3839	4.0	1	2014-10-26	Stopped by for lunch during a work day and this place was PACKED. The atmosphere is comfortable and rustic. The service was excellent. I loved the spicy lamb rigatoni...SO flavorful and the pasta was perfectly cooked!  I would return here just for this dish! We didn't have time for dessert...but maybe next time!
14409	3839	5.0	1	2014-10-15	Amazing food every time I go there, a little pricy, but totally worth it when you want a delicious brunch, in a cute little area. Beautiful decorations as well!
14410	3839	3.0	1	2014-10-13	I took my sister here for brunch looking for something new and different for her since she's from Las Vegas and they have pretty much the same restaurants there and then some. The WDC looked interesting from their website so I wanted to try it with my sister. We got to the restaurant with reservations and we were seated right away. I was so fond and amazed with all the dogs artwork and decor that I fell in love with the place right away since I am a dog lover...then we got the food. I ordered the pork belly croquette along with the truffle fries. The fried we're crunchy and fragrant and tasty while the pork belly croquette, not so much. The pork belly had a little taste to it but the croquettes were bland and it was mediocre, I tried to like but couldn't taste pass the blandness. It was the same for my sister's omelette as well, the feta gave her food the flavor it needed but otherwise, it was bland as well. The service was mediocre as well, the waitress was not to keen of being there on a Sunday I guess? I would go back again for dinner maybe just because I love dogs and willing to give it another try.
14411	3839	4.0	1	2014-10-11	Went here with a group of 8 and got booth seating - it isn't often that I sit in a restaurant with loose pillows on its booths. This decor gave the restaurant a very homey vibe. They handled our large group seamlessly. We were in and out in about an hour, which was impressive. The food: I got the fried pickles and the fish tacos - both were pretty good. I realized that I don't like fried pickles, but the chipotle aioli dipping sauce was creamy with a little kick, and the pickles served as a good vehicle to eat the sauce. Coming from California, I hold fish tacos to a certain standard. The fish tacos here were good and came with fried taro chips.
14412	3839	2.0	1	2014-10-11	I will give this 2 stars only because the apple pumpkin spice soup is amazing. I went with a friend for lunch and it took 5 minutes for anyone to even give us water, half and hour for us to order and an hour for the food to come. They gave us a free sangria which my friend had as I was already nursing a hangover. Her food was cold when it came, not just cool but actually cold. Our lunch overall took 2 and a half hours and it was 54 dollars to boot! 54 dollars for soup, a hummus plate, French toast, home fries and a mimosa ? I will most certainly not be returning- we are in college and wanted a tasty meal but now we are both broke and upset it took so long to eat. Our waiter, tommy, was very apologetic which was very sweet and I know it wasn't his fault but come on!
14413	3839	4.0	1	2014-10-11	"This place is fantastic.  During summer the outdoor seating area is very charming with a ""not so busy"" street. Indoors is even better. It's like walking through a nice home with different cute room with a slightly different theme although it's all dog related (which I really like).  The food is excellent!  I've had breakfast and lunch there a few times and I have yet to have something that I wasn't satisfied with. We live in Philadelphia and have access to a number of restaurants and still frequent this place. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it may be a little pricy... Although overall pretty reasonable. You must go at least once if you're in Philadelphia!"
14414	3839	4.0	1	2014-10-03	"Great atmosphere! Service was excellent. They have a small but diverse menu, but then again it's a small restaurant and the things they do they seem to do well. Started with a cocktail called ""grape mer...SQUIRREL"", good if you like a sweet drink, it had a sour edge though. Fried calamari appetizer was good sitting In a sweet sauce, with a mustard sauce applied. Calamari but the sauces made it. Everything is farm raised and organic. Salads seem unique, everyone in our party enjoyed their selections. I was in a burger mood so that was my choice. It was good, came the way I requested and our food did not take forever to come out. Fries with burger were good with Parmesan cheese sprinkles. Great decor. Very homey feel. Great experience. I would go again."
14415	3839	3.0	1	2014-09-30	This nicely attired place offers a fairly priced selection of food and drink. The choice between draft and bottled beer is extensive enough to satisfy most beer lovers. The various plates, while being attractively named, were somewhat flat in presentation and taste. Service was somewhat lacking when It came to refilling water glasses and following up on drinking and menu selections.
14416	3839	4.0	1	2014-09-30	I went here for lunch last week with my boyfriend, and it was good, though slightly pricey. We sat at the bar, so we got 10% off our check, which was nice. We started off with an arugula, proscuitto, and goat cheese salad, which was well-portioned for two as an appetizer, and was delicious as well. As an entree, I had the smaller portion of the rigatoni in the lamb bolognese sauce, which was well-cooked and perfectly portioned for a lunch, not to mention deceptively filling. My boyfriend had the turkey burger, which he enjoyed. The service at the bar was efficient and unobtrusive, which I liked. I would gladly go back, but probably only if someone else was paying.
14417	3839	5.0	1	2014-09-26	Fantastic! To start, service was impeccable. My server's name was Ian I believe, he was polite, attentive, really knowledgable about everything and had awesome recommendations. From everything I saw in the dining room it seemed like they have a really great staff all around, everyone seemed very professional and efficient. As for the food, the entire meal was incredible. Every dish came out quickly, and was presented beautifully. Every bite I had was better than the last. The squash gnocchi was insane. Awesome place, can't wait to get back!
14418	3839	3.0	1	2014-09-24	When they offer braised beef short rib and bone-in filet,  please order. Very pleasing to the the palate.
14419	3839	5.0	1	2014-09-16	Wow!   Very impressed!  Locally sourced, fresh food.   Everything was delicious.   I tried the lamb bolognese pasta, which, as other reviewers have commented, is simply amazing.  I asked for the recipe, to no avail.  My daughter had the crab cake and special scallops,which were fabulous, and another daughter had the lamb merguez, also delicious.A little on the expensive side, but definitely worth the price.  The decor is cozy and warm, featuring a dog motif (with blue dog paintings by George Rodrigue -- (it is the converted house of the owner, who founded the restaurant over 30 years ago), and is surprisingly capacious.  The staff is extremely professional and attentive.  A great place to go while visiting Penn!
10186	3839	4.0	1	2014-09-14	White Dog is a great place for brunch in University City. I would definitely recommend going to White Dog for brunch rather than dinner because the dinner items are a lot more pricey. For brunch, I usually get the Eggs Benedict. But I have also tried the omelet, turkey sandwich, and more. Everything I have had for brunch has been good. The menu items change slightly sometimes because they source their food from local farms. For Penn students, this is a great place to go with your parents when they are in town. It is also just good for brunch with some friends. If you are looking to day-drink, they offer bottomless drinks for $12 during brunch on the weekends.
10784	3839	3.0	1	2014-09-13	"I came here with a friend and we had a decent time, but it could have been better. The hostesses were great, but it got worse after that. 1) When I asked our server about an ingredient in one of their Mocktails, he explained it to me. Then, he changed the subject and spewed out the specials before I could order a drink. And then he left. Throughout the meal, he seemed really distracted and like he didn't want to be there. 2) I am SO HAPPY that there is a vegan entree (the ravioli) and it is pretty good. 3) I got the eggplant side dish and it was fantastic, but I wish our waiter would have said ""Hey, our side dishes are ENORMOUS - please consider sharing"". I didn't choose something that my friend and I both wanted, and I took home the extra. This wouldn't have been a big deal except that the takeover container leaked all over my everything. 4) It is great that you get a discount for sitting at the bar during lunchtime - what a great way to seat more people! I won't go here again because it was really too expensive for the food that we got. It was *nothing special*."
14420	3839	4.0	1	2014-09-08	I've been here 4-5 times and have loved it each time! I went here with a few friends this weekend and ordered the Eggs Benedict. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the Hollandaise sauce was delicious. It comes with a side of potatoes which were seasoned well. I love the ambiance here too! The dog-themed decor is fun and quirky. The space is huge and the wait usually isn't too bad. You can get 10% off your bill if you sit by the bar area. I'd also recommend getting the bottomless mimosas/bloody marys/sangrias on the weekends. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service can be a little slow and serving sizes are rather small given the price. Will definitely be going back there soon nonetheless!
7871	3839	3.0	1	2014-09-05	We came for a group lunch, and the ambiance was great, as always.  We were seated in the back room, and surrounding by these whimsical images of bull terriers, which was certainly interesting.  Our server was friendly and got our order right, for the most part (forgot to put one dressing on the side).  The food itself was solid, and the vegetables were especially fresh (notably the avocado and heirloom tomatoes).  My blackened shrimp salad was good and came with five large shrimp, and plenty of tomatoes, although there wasn't very much bacon.  The pancetta topping gave it a nice crunch and boost of flavor.  I also asked for the green goddess dressing instead, which they were very happy to substitute, and, while it was more tangy than expected, it was still very good and paired well with the avocado.  To be honest, I think that a sprinkling of feta would have been a wonderful addition.  The rolls are your basic brioche and sesame- and poppy-seeded ones.  They also have a $15 lunch combo, which includes mixed greens, a cup of soup, and a half of a ham sandwich, which isn't a bad deal.  Overall, still a solid restaurant in University City.
14421	3839	3.0	1	2014-08-29	"I've been here several times over the past few years and like it. The products they use are great and local, and service and  the whole place is very nice. However, the chef here needs some adult supervision because despite excellent craftsmanship in the plates, the beautiful natural flavors are lost in way too overdone preparations and seasoning. Example - the merguez  lamb sausage.  Nicely done, neatly made they look more like large German bratwurst and the lamb way too finely ground and way way too fatty and rich. Accompanied by nice chick peas but they are drowned in an intense overly abundant red pepper sauce. Also a very strange cake like ""Thing"" of some sort in that dish which tasted like semi dried plaster. If it were not nicely shaped I would have thought it fell off the ceiling. The white bean ""vegan"" ravioli was just plain bad but not because it was poorly made - the pasta expertly done - but white bean filing - no. And the dried TOMATOS in crazy abundance over it just silly. Lots of flavor yes - but like  a Jackson Pollock paint splatter versus a Van Gogh landscape. Perhaps if they had a notice on the menu that vegans deserve a mess like this Id appreciate it more. Mysteriously cheap on the otherwise nice salad. Not enough greens to feed a baby rabbit. This is not a stingy kitchen by any means but why they are so chincy with the salads in a farm to table place is beyond me.   The beef empanadas were very good. But they are shown on menu as ""small plates"" but arrived huge and dressed up in all sorts of sauce and condiments befitting a Houlihans. That said they were excellent but again way over the top with too much going on masking very good stuff inside. Desserts very disappointing and strange. A overly polished blondie with peanut butter and chocolate - and an underpolished fruit crisp reminiscent of a school bake sale.   Nice wine selection but overly pricey choices except by the glass where the price range is good but the selection only fair. Hey - it's Philadelphia so what can I say? But I really think with a more mature or experienced Exec and more attention to letting  wonderful ingredients shine on their own this could be a much better place.  Despite that it's friendly, comfie inside and pleasant. Id keep it a lot simpler next time."
14422	3839	2.0	1	2014-08-08	If White Dog Cafe brings back the crab cake with risotto, I will up the rating to 3 stars. That dish was GOOD! Apparently, they change their menus frequently. They had that dish back in 2011, and I've been returning occasionally to try other dishes that would match up to it. I left disappointed each time. The burger was just okay, the wild Alaskan salmon salad was dry, and soups were mediocre. The creme brulee was good, but I've tried better. The bread pudding was WAY TOO SWEET. I gave the restaurant a lot of chances, but based on my experiences so far, I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. Even though the ingredients are organic, the taste does not live up to its price. The restaurant's decor is really cute though. The low lighting and little dog decorations everywhere give it a really homey feeling.
14423	3839	4.0	1	2014-08-08	We had a work lunch here. I had the pulled pork sandwich with some kind of korean spicy sauce. It was ok. Th four stars are for our server, I forgot his name but he was absolutely great. The decor and ambience is nice as well.
14424	3839	5.0	1	2014-08-06	Great food great service I have no complaint.  I came during University city restaurant week last summer and I am still thinking about how much I enjoyed myself.
14425	3839	4.0	1	2014-08-04	Really good food, but I wish their menu had more things to choose from! The fries were delicious and so were our main entrees (panini and burger). I definitely recommend customers sit at the bar to be served because there's a 10% discount if you do!
14426	3839	5.0	1	2014-07-21	Excellent farm to table food, I was here for a sampler menu and had honeydew carpaccio, fried oysters with watermelon, seared trout, and a desert. To top it all off it was a wonderful day and I sat outside. If I am back on Philly I will definitely come back here again. I am really glad that I happened upon this place.
14427	3839	5.0	1	2014-07-18	Hands down, White Dog Cafe has the most consistent amazing meals, whether it be for brunch, lunch, or dinner.  There is great ambiance indoors and out (when the weatehr cooperates).  I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a delicious, locally sourced meal.
14428	3839	3.0	1	2014-07-14	Liked this place but didn't love it. The atmosphere and decor is nice but I didn't think the food was that outstanding for the price. We were staying at a nearby hotel with our dog and decided to give it a try since they allow you to sit outside with your pooch. For brunch I got eggs benedict -- my poached eggs were undercooked and the english muffins were burnt. Pretty disappointing. The people working there were very nice though. I wouldn't be opposed to going back and giving it another try but it's not first on my list.
14429	3839	5.0	1	2014-07-13	I've been here twice before and it was nothing less of amazing each time. I recently went to brunch with friends on Saturday morning after a long and eventful night. It was my first time having brunch there but it definitely won't be the last. I love the atmosphere of the place. The decor is amazing and definitely adds to the experience. The staff is very attentive as well as friendly. All six of us ended up getting the eggs Benedict and Id have to say, it was mouth watering. The hollandaise sauce was the best I've had yet.
14430	3839	4.0	1	2014-07-08	One of the better brunch options in University City. Perfectly runny eggs benedict. I suggest the bottomless brunch (greyhounds, mimosas, bloody maries). Always friendly service and make sure to bring your dog!
10063	3839	3.0	1	2014-07-06	I've not been here in ages. The portions are small for it's very high end price and feel. Wait staff were quite attentive. The variety of menu was decent. I guess I just expect my dollar to travel further.
14431	3839	5.0	1	2014-06-28	"I travel a lot for work and I am not a big portions kinda guy, if you are this may not be your number one pick (and go buy a hoggie somewhere) but if you want amazing quality over quantity, a nice atmosphere, to impress a date or friends, or just to treat yourself to something really good this is the place. The beet arugula salad was fantastic which I paired with the Evil Genius ""I love lamp"" a pineapple wheat beer in the German heffenwise style. Next course I did the Stoudt's leg lifter, a beer made for this establishment which I paired with a tandoori inspire chicken platter with cous cous, zucinni and cilantro with a lemon vinaigrette. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and tender, you had the flavor of tandoori but it was subtle. In retrospect, that pairing is a bit odd but the bitter and sweetness worked. The waitstaff were very accommodating and friendly. I was so impressed by evertlything I had to have dessert. I ordered the wildflower honey creme bruise even though I was already full. The extra flavors made it feel more rich and complex. It came with some interesting dog bone shaped organic sugar covered cookie. I'd say as for food in the Atlantic Metropolitan region of the country this has to be my new number one, the only place I've found that can compete on the East Coast so far was in Northhampton Mass.  I love lamp, and I love White dog tavern. I will be back... I really don't want to leave now."
5065	3839	4.0	1	2014-06-27	good grub
14432	3839	4.0	1	2014-06-23	"The meal was inventively prepared, very fresh, and consistent with ""foodie"" standards.  I was in from out of town and it really connected me to the local food/farm feel of the mid Atlantic.  I felt like I was in the ""place,"" not just another upscale business dinner.  Quaint atmosphere, good service levels too.  The main thing is the food, though, in my opinion.  The complimentary melon juice shooters were a real bonus."
14433	3839	5.0	1	2014-06-17	Go here. As soon as possible. The food is fresh and delicious! A little on the pricier side, but worth it. Insider tip: at lunch you get 10% off your check if you sit in the bar area.
14434	3839	4.0	1	2014-06-16	Dropped in for drinks at happy hour.  It was pretty quiet most of the time, good for conversation.  The beer (Carpe Nocturne) was cold, daark, and tasty, and we also enjoyed a cheese platter and Mac&Cheese with Bacon.  Not bad, at all, and the staff were helpful without being obtrusive. The rest rooms are good too.
14435	3839	2.0	1	2014-06-13	Writing this review pains me; being in the University City area for work, White Dog has always been a delicious treat. Their lamb bolognese (rigatoni), tuna tartare, and cheese plates have always been decadent. Last night, it was as if I was at a completely different restaurant; the prices have seemingly gone up for entrees and the portions remind me of a tapas style restaurant. One of my friends ordered the cod, and the other the Tandoori Chicken, and I had the ravioli (the half portion), which turned out to be $17...for 3 pieces of ravioli. For a total bill of over $150, I was sorely disappointed in the food portions and prices.
14436	3839	5.0	1	2014-06-11	Pricey but very good! We went on a crowded night (new Penn students & their parents) but received complimentary drinks to make up for the wait. Our waiter, Josh, was very friendly & informative about their menu. For our entrees we ordered the duck with mushrooms and the chicken that comes with INCREDIBLE bacon mac & cheese. Literally mouthwatering! Even if you don't order the chicken dish, order the mac & cheese as a side for only $7. I was going to give it four stars due to price but it is what it is. Appropriate for a higher end restaurant, especially counsidering they work exclusively with local places within a 300 mile radius.
14437	3839	4.0	1	2014-06-08	The white dog cafe is a quaint little cafe that offers a delicious menu and cozy atmosphere. They no longer have bottomless drink options but they did lower the price to make up for it. The prices may be a little steep for a breakfast stop but it's well worth it. Everyone in my group enjoyed their meals. Our waitress was adorable and nice. The decor is very cute and interesting. It's definitely worth checking out!
14438	3839	4.0	1	2014-05-30	Mushroom soup is absolutely delish, I get it every time! Turkey burger & fries were also good. A little bit of a wait for our food today, but the service was attentive.
14439	3839	4.0	1	2014-05-20	Let me say at the out set that I was here for dessert recently and haven't been here for dinner in a while. Dessert was great.  I had the polenta pound cake with butter pecan ice cream.   Very good but very small for $9.  My dining partner got the oatmeal bread pudding with strawberry gelee.   This was served warm in a stylized mason jar.   I had order envy.   It was delicious and looked great.
14440	3839	5.0	1	2014-05-19	I love White Dog. The menu got a little stale about 2 years ago, where it was the same for months on end and the meals weren't that great, but since they swapped up the menu ---- amazing! Really enjoyed some of the flatbreads and salad dishes. Everything is always so fresh and flavorful. The service is always friendly - the hostesses are helpful and smiling and the staff have a sense of humor and are always available when you need them. The cocktails kick butt too. I love coming back here every time I'm in Philly.

After I went inside ""oh wow it's really nice looking"" Unless you are taking out it is good to make a reservation otherwise you have to wait a bit. The price shocked me the most, they offer a appetizer and entree size. The cheapest entree starts at $14 and the portions are not too great for the cost. I ordered the pasta fussilini or whatever it's called. I ordered the appetizer size for $17.00. Once I got my order I was disappointed. It was a tiny miniscule box. My tv dinners from Wal-Mart gives more food for the value. The entree size cost a whopping $25.00 and that is before taxes, hence me opting in for a smaller size.  Go here if you want to pay high costs for a snack-size meal.  But to give it something positive in my review, the food tastes great. It probably didn't help that tonight was the University of Pennsylvania's graduation dinner lol."

Two of us had no wait for a table, even though it looked pretty busy, and the service was quick. Above all, the food was amazing. We had beet salad, buratta salad, salmon and pork tenderloin. There wasn't a bad bite!
14443	3839	5.0	1	2014-05-13	"Great meal! One of the best we've had in a while. Reasonable portion sizes with a focus on quality, freshness, and flavor. They use ""locally sourced"" ingredients. I had Rainbow Trout with Ramp Pesto, Fiddleheads, Maitakes, Sprouted Farro, Sherry Vinaigrette, and my wife selected from the Market Menu (which changes periodically), and had salmon with a soy ginger glaze, pea pods, and pearled barley. Dessert was yellow plum sorbet for me and strawberry mousse for Laurie. Not a bargain meal, but worth the price."
14444	3839	5.0	1	2014-05-11	Go for brunch!  One of the few bottomless brunch places in Philadelphia (believe me, I looked) and such a cute quaint place.  Bottomless mimosas are only $14, which is such a steal. I got the three-egg omelet and it was fantastic -- the goat cheese and sundried tomatoes gave it great flavor.  The others in my party got the pasta and really enjoyed it.   Great place to come with friends or take family!
14445	3839	5.0	1	2014-05-11	I created a Yelp account just to write the most positive review possible for White Dog Cafe. I went for brunch today and the experience was more than I could have expected. I have heard many reviews of the White Dog, and I always thought it might be a bit out of my price range, but I wanted to take my mom somewhere nice for Mother's Day and White Dog fit the bill. The brunch menu actually is as affordable as any brunch place in West Philly/University City, plus they have an amazing drink special: unlimited mimosas, sangria (red or white), greyhounds, and bloody Marys for only $14 per person. I got the chicken and biscuits, which was fantastic. Crispy, delicious chicken with a mix of white and dark meat, flavorful biscuits, gravy, side salad, and a perfectly cooked egg on the side. I don't usually have a huge appetite, but I ate every bite! My mom got the brioche French toast, which she also enjoyed. It was a large portion and she was able to take some home with her. My boyfriend got the pork belly, which was beautifully prepared with a nice semi-char on the outside of the meat. It came with a side of kimchi, which he didn't necessarily enjoy as much as he could have, because it wasn't traditional cabbage kimchi, but more of a pickled salad of spinach and carrots. However, it was a matter of preference, and all of the portions were generous. Additionally,  the drinks were flowing, and there was never a long wait for a refill. Speaking of drinks--they were quite good. I started with two mimosas, which were made with freshly squeezed orange juice and decent champagne. Afterwards, I switched to the red sangria, which was pleasantly dry and not overly sweet. Our wonderful waitress did not mind that we took our time while taking advantage of the unlimited drinks, which we very much appreciated. After a while, though, the restaurant needed to free up our table for their next customers, but they invited us to continue drinking at the bar with comped desserts since we had to give up our table. They were extremely professional and friendly about asking us to move, and we did not mind at all. Once at the bar, the bartender began pouring our drinks in pint glasses instead of the usual wine glasses. He took great care of us. We felt a bit bad ordering the free desserts since we felt the move to the bar may have been due to outstaying our welcome, but the bartender was informed of the comped desserts and suggested that we go ahead and order. We were going to split just the creme brulee between the three of us, but the bartender suggested we also get the bread pudding. It was a much welcome suggestion, as the bread pudding was custardy, deliciously eggy, and had just the right amount of sweetness, with tart cherries on top. Our drinks were refilled promptly as we enjoyed our desserts. Overall, there is no question that we had a 5-star experience at the White Dog Cafe today.
14446	3839	3.0	1	2014-05-04	Pretty expensive for hit or miss dishes. Hits: the pancakes. Misses: the tofu dishes and the sides are all pretty underwhelming.
14447	3839	3.0	1	2014-05-04	Brunch are only served on the weekends !   Its a nice place to have brunch if you don't feel like traveling to  Rittenhouse square. They have a room with couch seating and lamp on the table , also with dog murals hanging on the wall. It is so cute and cozy ! I tried their mushroom soup, lancaster omelet, eggs Benedict and the beef brisket. The soup I couldn't remember much of it , nothing special . The omelet was very fresh , I liked the complimentary salad on the side. Egg Benedict was mediocre to me  and the beef brisket was dry and flavorless . Give it a try if you live in university city or don't feel like driving anywhere on a raining day.
14448	3839	3.0	1	2014-05-03	"People really like to say that White Dog is the best brunch place this side of the Schuykill, so I had rather high expectations for the place. I came with a large group of 15, so we were seated in a nice corner downstairs with couch seating and portraits of dogs, which made for excellent scenery for this canine lover. I got the pork belly with kimchi and an egg sunny side up. The pork belly was just like any other pork belly I've had, in three different slices. My only gripe would probably be that there was a little less fat on these than I'm used to, and I am a believer that pork belly needs a certain fat to lean meat ratio in order to have the right balance of meatiness and savoriness. The egg was nice and runny, just like at home. However, the kimchi was a major turnoff. Myself and others in my part who ordered the same dish all agreed that the kimchi was 1) just spinach; and 2) way too salty. It was almost painful to eat, and while I managed to finish what was on my plate, suffice to say it was the only thing left on our plates. I have always been hesitant when more traditional ""American"" restaurants try to incorporate such deeply Asian foods into their dishes. In this case, I'm not sure even if it was well executed the different things on the dish would fit together."
12378	3839	4.0	1	2014-04-24	First time at this place, and I can say I am a fan of their food. It wasn't anything SPECTACULAR, but I would definatley go again. I really enjoyed their burger and mocktail which was the highlight of my lunch. Only thing is that it was quite pricey ( at least for a college student). But overall I felt very satisfied after eating there!
14449	3839	4.0	1	2014-04-21	I only come here for the meat fries. I forget what they are called but it is so good. It's more than your ordinary cheese fries. They add meat on it and even a fried egg. The smell is heavenly. I always finish it in less than five minutes. Sadly it's super unhealthy but whatevs
14450	3839	3.0	1	2014-04-19	I have been looking forward to going for sooooooo long. It was-- wait for it-- not that exciting.... Our waiter was fun and great, he gets five stars.  The inside of the restaurant is really cool, that gets five stars.  The food was such a disappointment.  My fiancé had the fixed menu and I ordered a la carte.  My soup was good.  Hi mackerel was icky.  The risotto was AWESOME!  My tofu was dripping in butter and his steak was half the size of any other restaurant.  The molten cake had no lava :-(. I would go back for the ambiance alone but probably not the food.  It was overpriced for what it was.
14451	3839	1.0	1	2014-04-19	"Hello, Last night I had a wonderful meal (tuna tartar, duck, root beer float) and great service at White Dog. Here's why I'll never be back. I arrived with a group of 6 family members - we go a few times a year because it's convenient to 30th street station when my in-laws come to town. We were given menus - 4 of us were ordering priced fix. 2 were not. O wait, actually 0 are, because despite nothing noted on the menu, the new policy is that the priced fix meal must be ordered by the whole table, our server informed us kindly. We offered to be put on 2 checks. The manager came out and told us it was the chef's rule, ""for our own good and the good of our experience"" because it would be so hard for us to when to eat what if some people didn't have food in front of them. Stupid, but tolerable. And the priced fix options had $ next to them, so since they could be purchased a la carte, we got over it. And THEN we were told we couldn't have a LA carte from that special menu - even though the menu said ""items available a LA carte"" on the menu, because that's only available for groups smaller then 4. So my mother in law couldn't have the burrata. My sister in law couldn't have the scallops. What are you even thinking, White Dog? My table had ordered 2 bottles of wine, we were frequent visitors... I'm going to make it my job to tell everyone I know about my bad experience. Enough with the silly rules and stodginess from the lil cafe that use to be about quality in farm to table. You look like jerks.p"
14452	3839	4.0	1	2014-04-18	If you want to try White Dog, go for brunch on Saturdays or Sundays! Honestly, I never find dinner to be worth the price (unless you have a 1000-point OpenTable reservation at 9:30 PM on a weekday) and lunch isn't too special. White Dog rotates the menu, so you can keep coming back and ordering the new, freshest dishes. I've never heard a complaint about any of their brunch dishes, so I recommend them all! The portions are pretty large, especially for heavier dishes like biscuits and gravy. I cannot say this enough times: bottomless mimosas, Bloody Marys, greyhounds, and sangria during weekend brunches for $12. BOTTOMLESS FOR $12. This means you can literally just get two drinks and get your money's worth... but we know we're all getting at least four or five. The servers are very nice and polite, but I think they sometimes have too many tables to deal with, especially at popular brunch hours. You have to wait a while to get your drinks sometimes, so just order in advance--they'll let you keep multiple glasses if you're working on 'em. White Dog comes off as one of the nicer places on campus... a lot of more mature folks and law students can be spotted here. Feel free to invade during brunch (drunch?) hours anyway.
14453	3839	1.0	1	2014-04-18	I've eaten here many many times but this may have been my last. Completely unpredictable and unreliable food quality and service. Sometimes it's excellent and all too often it's awful.  And when it's awful, it's not just not good, it's really awful. I just had the Maryland Striped Bass with seared prawn, porcini mushrooms and vegetables. It was inedible. Fish was not fresh, prawn was a limp grey flavorless mess, and what I assume were supposed to be porcini mushrooms were unrecognizable rubbery bits with a nasty off-taste. One other member if my party ordered the same dish and also found it awful. Others at the table received their food cold or other similar problems. I'd have sent my meal back if it hadn't been a  dinner with professional colleagues where that would have been out of line. Service was slow and inattentive.   All in all, I'd rather have skipped dinner.  This meal was so bad, it will be a while before might even consider going back.
14454	3839	5.0	1	2014-04-15	Excellent food, service and atmosphere.  Our party of 6 decided to order the 4 course prefix. My main dish was trout and it was delicious. The ingredients are top notch and I will be back.
14455	3839	3.0	1	2014-04-11	I came here on Valentine's Day with my girlfriend. I ordered from the prix fixe and she ordered from the regular menu. Our server came back about 15 minutes later saying that both or neither of us would need to order off the prix fixe. A little disappointing, but I figured I would just order off the regular menu. Before he brought a menu back both of our appetizers came out. Seemingly everything was fine! Then the server came back with a menu and took my plate back. A manager walked by and noticed only one of us with food. He apparently talked to the server because my appetizer came back and I didn't have to order something different. That was the beginning of somewhat strange service. The food was pretty good and maybe the poor service was a fluke. Although I'm not in a hurry to go back.
14456	3839	5.0	1	2014-04-09	Really enjoyed our night out here. Good food, slightly eccentric experience, great ingredients and accommodating of allergies. Highlights: the gluten-free rolls (you have to request them) are warm and DELICIOUS. I am desperately searching for a recipe that will come close for home! Also the home made ice cream... Yum.
14457	3839	1.0	1	2014-04-06	So do I start when I called and try to add one more for the reservation that was made a week ago and they had the name down but couldn't find the reservation time... We  have a large party of 12 which when we got to the private room was impressed.. Our server was sweet but seemed brand new.  As we ordered our bottomless drinks  we  enjoyed the room.  I read on the yelp review how are you doing some customers loved the bread that was given in the beginning.. No bread was brought out until I actually got up and asked for a  manager .. Not only did I speak to him about no bread but also my entree and another's was cold.. So they took our entrees and came back with the same temperature entree.COLD!  I didn't want to send it back a third time and just ate what I could.  The bottomless drinks were nice but it took awhile to get a few rounds in.  I brought a small cake for my daughters birthday and was told there would be a $3.00 a person cutting fee for any outside food brought. So we  decided to wait for cake after we left. The waiter did not even offer the birthday girl a birthday dessert.  What he seemed concerned about was letting us know that their was no big group tip and that there were suggested tips on the bill.  He was very nice but food and service was lousy.  The ambiance of the private room was nice but when you get a large room and a large group  what tends to happen is everyone in that room will tell their experience and pass it on.   More attention needs to be made to the basics.
14458	3839	4.0	1	2014-04-03	"I came here with my parents for my 30th birthday over the weekend.  I had thought ahead and made a reservation, which was pretty clutch given the bad weather.  My mom had recently broken her shoulder, so she was in a sling.  We dropped her off out front since she can't carry a purse AND an umbrella, so we had hoped she'd get the table, and we'd just meet her.  Turns out they wouldn't sit her down until we had all arrived, so she was getting bumped a bit... which given the size/severity of her injury, wasn't great news.  What was great news is that my mother has a big mouth, so she spoke to the host, explained the circumstances, and they made an exception for her.  I REALLY appreciated that. We sat down at a nice table in a big, colorful room.  I ordered the bottomless mimosas which i interpreted as a challenge.  Upon reviewing the menu, it was clear that the pretzel cinnamon bun was going to have to happen as an appetizer to split.  I also went for the Mushroom omelette.   Our waiter, Joe, was very pleasant.  He kept the drinks coming as best he could (the bar got a little backed up), and he had a really great personality that made him a pleasure.  He brought out our breakfast bread basket that i assume every table gets that is full of blueberry bread, cranberry bread, and this bread that tasted like carrot cake minus the frosting.  They came accompanied by butter, but I didn't really think that they even needed it! The pretzel cinnamon bun came out next... COVERED in frosting... which was really great news.  Then came the entrees.  My omelette was good... but not great.  The mushrooms were a bit overdone and bity, but the onions were delicious.  The omelette was supposed to also have a cheddar on it, but I really didn't taste very much of that.  Being a cheese fan, I saw this as a huge missed opportunity.  It came with some yams and a salad that had an amazing mustard vinegarette dressing that I've been dreaming about ever since. Everyone in my family seemed to enjoy their meal too.  My boyfriend got the country fried steak.  He said that the egg on top was well done, which meant that the yoke was cooked fully.  He said that his steak was a bit dry, but he thought that if the egg yolk was runnier, it could have acted as a great sauce... but it just didn't work out correctly.  Another close, but not quite.   Finally, in typical fashion, my family ordered a little piece of cake which was sent out on a plate that had ""Happy Birthday"" written on the side in chocolate.  It was really delicious and really beautiful.   The meal + the mimosas landed me in a couch coma for the remainder of the day, which given the weather was just where I wanted to be.  It was quite a treat thru and thru.  The atmosphere is fabulous as is the service.  The kitchen can use a little bit of work, but overall, i'd be back here again."
14459	3839	4.0	1	2014-03-30	The food is phenomenal. I had the organic tofu and fell in love. My only issue was that the online menu didn't totally match the menu at the actual cafe. However the great food made up for it. I would recommend this for a business dinner or birthday because it is a bit expensive. I would definitely eat here again.
7924	3839	4.0	1	2014-03-28	So I overthought the pointer and setter thing. I get it now! Anyway, I was looking at my old review after I came here again for the first time in a long time, and my experience got me thinking that I reaaaally need to come to happy hour here more often. You can't beat five dollar tuna tartare in soy reduction, or five dollar Kennet Square mushroom soup. Also, Victory Storm King. Sixteen ounces of heavenly, 9.7 percent ABV extra stout. Please never change, White Dog.
14460	3839	4.0	1	2014-03-25	Sea bass had great texture, taste and was well seasoned. Oysters were a bit small for the price. Amuse bouche was nice. Eclectic decor. Excellent service.
12033	3839	4.0	1	2014-03-22	There were 7 in out group, and we ordered quite a bit of food. First, about the atmosphere: we felt pretty cramped where we were sitting, but we managed. One thing was that it wasn't especially loud, and I was grateful for that. We all started with appetizers. The menu had just changed for the season, but the server was well-versed in all the dishes and right on target with all his recommendations. In fact, his service was smooth, easy and very professional. I shared the oysters on the half shell and the mushroom soup as an app. The oysters were a huge disappointment. They were overpriced, teeny and every one had loose shells. Ordering them was a mistake. The flavor of the mushroom soup was good, but it was served warm, not hot. I had a salmon entree. Because of my gluten sensitivity, my server was very accommodating about letting me change sides, so I didn't the the gnocci that was usually served with that dish. My salmon was perfectly cooked--between medium rare and rare, just as I'd ordered. The frisee and shaved asparagus side was light and a perfect compliment to the fish. For dessert, I had the grapefruit and pepper sorbet, and I loved that, even though it was pretty icy. The flavor was great, and the pepper was nicely balanced. Overall, I left satisfied, and would definitely go back. It had been years since I've been, but I'd definitely return.
14461	3839	4.0	1	2014-03-16	"If I'm being completely honest, I'm giving this place an extra star solely for the fact that they have the BEST brunch booze options I've seen in a while in this city.The only thing that would make it better would be a brunch buffet instead of a brunch menu. $12 for unlimited mimosas, greyhounds, sangria AND Bloody Marys?!!!!????!!! I'm pretty sure it doesn't get better than that. I had 3 and that's ONLY b/c we weren't seated until almost 1:50p. Next time, I'll be earlier lol. Now for the food! First things first, they give a complimentary basket of baked goods to the table and man, are they good! Lavender coffeecake, chocolate chip scones, & banana bread were in our basket. Yum! To be honest, the food here may be a bit overpriced for the amount that was served, but I didn't feel cheated. Partially because I guess that's the price you pay for farm-to-table ingredients, and also because I thoroughly enjoyed everything I ordered personally. I ordered the buttermilk pancakes and the thick-cut bacon.This was great! At first, I was a little annoyed because they wouldn't allow me to substitute the sweet potato hash for the sunny side up egg in the brisket dish, as I don't eat eggs. (outside of being baked in cakes, used as a binder in certain dishes etc.), and I thought the pancakes would be boring. I was WRONG! The menu online described the pancakes as having pomegranate accompaniments, but that wasn't what the menu we were given offered. The pancakes I had came with some sort of whipped basil infused cream, candied lemon shreds, and either lemon or grapefruit wedges on top. Coupled with the maple syrup, it tasted wonderful! The amalgam of flavors was pretty damned great...and the bacon..ohhh don't get me started on the bacon! Thick-cut, well-cooked and they give you a LOT of it. I was in heaven. Unfortunately, the other dishes we ordered weren't as impressive. My cousin ordered the country-fried steak initially. The steak was tough and was really lacking in flavor. We sent it back and ordered the beef brisket in its place. I'd heard good things about the brisket, but it was underwhelming as well and nothing like we expected. It came as a ""brick"" of brisket. It was cooked well, but it wasn't sliced..it was just a block of brisket, and the dish had no sauce to tie it together with the chilaquiles that accompanied it. Had she ordered the dish with the sunny-side up egg as described, that could've been used as the sauce. But since she didn't, you would think that they would've made a quick sauce or reduction to bind the meal. All they did was add some spring mix to the plate with a vinaigrette. We also ended the meal w/an apple shortcake dessert. This was just okay as well. The service was pretty good. Nothing to complain about in that respect. We waited about 35 mins for a table since we didn't have a reservation, but the staff kept us updated on the progress intermittently. The atmosphere is great. It's quaint and upbeat, albeit quite small and a little difficult to navigate, so it may not be the best place for large groups, unless using their event space. The restaurant was flooded with lots of college students, but hey, that's University City for you. Can't wait to try the Wayne location!"
14462	3839	5.0	1	2014-03-16	This place is great! I went here with a group of my friends for my best friend's birthday. After telling the restaurant before hand that it was her birthday they had a card waiting for her. We all ordered bottomless brunch and the drinks came quickly and weren't watered down. Our waiter was Casey, he was very attentive and never made us feel rushed to leave. The food was delicious and the portions were huge. We will most definitely be returning!!
6817	3839	4.0	1	2014-03-14	This wonderful little spot in University City offers a charming ambiance and creative menu. At its heart, White Dog is a boutique date spot, quaint and intimate. It's almost like an upscale bed and breakfast. Attached is a great bar with balanced cocktails and a quality draft list. It's great for a classier happy hour with a lively atmosphere.
11627	3839	4.0	1	2014-03-10	$12 for bottomless mimosas, bloodies, sangria AND greyhounds?!   I had seven.  I think I just won at brunch.  Strike that.  Drunch.
14463	3839	5.0	1	2014-02-09	A perennial favorite for my family.  We can always find food we all enjoy.  Excellent for entertaining guests as well.  Recommend it for family or professional gatherings.
14464	3839	4.0	1	2014-02-09	Food is very good and fresh, The atmosphere is very private and intimate. Good place to bring a date. Do yourself a favor and get the Saucony Creek Schnicklefritz beer, it will not let you down.
14465	3839	5.0	1	2014-02-06	The coziest place in town, excellent food, relaxing and has a lot of charm, a must visit place if you already haven't .
14466	3839	4.0	1	2014-02-02	Loved happy hour sitting at the bar. Fried pickles and tuna tartare were great choices. Sitting at certain parts of the bar were a bit hectic as they get lots of foot traffic from patrons entering the restaurant so just watch out for that and you're golden.
14467	3839	4.0	1	2014-01-20	My girlfriend and I went to the White Dog Cafe for a late lunch one day shortly after we learned about it.  I ate here with someone else for dinner prior and decided to bring her to try it as I enjoyed my experience.  The time I went here without her I had beef carpaccio and short rib.  Both of these were extremely good which caused me to come back a few days later.  This time it was for lunch with my girlfriend.  We decided to share the yellowfin tuna tartare for our first course which was very good and seemed fresh.  As for our entrees, I had the pulled berkshire pork sandwich and she had the koch farm turkey burger.  She enjoyed her burger and surprisingly I enjoyed the pork sandwich as I ordered it out on the limb since I had too many cheeseburgers within the week before.  This restaurant also has an atmosphere like a house.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal.
11589	3839	4.0	1	2014-01-19	DISCLOSURE: This review is only based off of a brunch experience. This place is adorable and is close to campus, which is why I find it to be a convenient spot if I'm looking to go somewhere slightly nicer than the other places on campus. That being said, prices are definitely kind of steep but the food is really tasty, most definitely. I've tried the flatbread on the brunch menu as well as the stuffed french toast dish (which rotates and changes every so often but mine was a nutella and marshmallow fluff one), which was one of the best french toast dishes I've had yet. The menu always looks incredibly appetizing and I actually really do want to come here again soon. I wish the prices were slightly less expensive (which is the reason for the -1 star) but the place is adorable with dim lighting and cute decor and the service has never been an issue either.
14468	3839	3.0	1	2014-01-19	--2.5 stars-- Food Quality: 3 stars Food Quantity: 2 stars Service: 3 stars Price: 2 stars Came here for Sunday brunch, and ordered the pomegranate buttermilk pancakes and the country fried steak and orange juice. Wasn't too impressed with either entree, but the (fresh-squeezed) juice was pretty good. The first entree came with 4 pancakes the size of saucer plates. I prefer my pancakes on the fluffy side, but these were dense ad mushy-tasting. Pomegranate seeds in and on the pancakes were a nice touch. However the pomegranate molasses that was described on the menu was sparsely smeared on the plate and didn't add anything to the dish. The country fried steak was somewhat of a disappointment. There were two small pieces of steak, both extremely tough and  flavorless. There was barely enough gravy on the bottom of the plate for even one piece of steak. The only thing that saved the dish a bit was the sweet potato hash. Service was standard. Took the waitress awhile to get us the check though. Overall, food was mediocre and overpriced. The bill came out to be over $50 with tax and tip ($12 for two skinny glasses of OJ??). Won't be back again.
5627	3839	2.0	1	2014-01-16	Overpriced, trying-too-hard food and extremely slow service. This is the kind of place you take your grandparents/parents or a Penn professor to, because you know who's footing the bill.
14469	3839	5.0	1	2014-01-13	"My boyfriend and I wanted to have a nice dinner in the city for the start of the new year and our anniversary coming up. 21 months only, but we're corny and like to celebrate our love- don't judge. After reading countless reviews and even getting told to come here from a West Philly native, I decided White Dog Cafe would be an excellent choice. I called to make a reservation the day before (it was Friday.. wanted a reservation for Saturday night) and the girl on the phone was super friendly. I asked her if they did anything special for an anniversary and she explained to me that they can write ""Happy Anniversary"" on our dessert plate. So cute! I was excited already and I knew my boyfriend would be embarassed, which made me more excited-ha! We arrived and we were seated right away. From the moment he approached our table, our server was so friendly and personable. We started with the ChickPea Fritters. They did not dissapoint. We were also brought bread with homemade butter made with honey, vanilla, and sea salt. Yum! For dinner, I had the Scottish Salmon, which was served with Kale and Gnocchi. My boyfriend had the Green Meadow Cheddar Burger served with Truffle Fries. My food was so fresh and delicious and my boyfriend says his dinner was great. For dessert, we tried this Chocolate Tart that had Caramel Popcorn on it, yes, popcorn. It was actually so good. They did write ""Happy Anniversary"" on the plate and my boyfriend was both embarassed (I knew it!) and happy. They even brought us complimentary champagne, which was such a nice touch. For all of this, the price really wasn't that high. For the quality of food you get, it's worth the price you pay. The atmosphere of the restaurant is so welcoming and like the other reviews say, use the bathroom! The bathrooms are really cool, haha. I recommend White Dog Cafe to anyone!"
11608	3839	3.0	1	2014-01-08	Had the Cauliflower steak, it was a little bland in my opinion and very chewy for a medium rare cook. Friends had fries, that was good. The decor was pretty old fashion and homey. I haven't tried their burgers and sandwiches, I heard those were good though.
14470	3839	5.0	1	2014-01-03	I eat here a lot and have always had great food. I especially love the mushroom soup which is the best I've ever had. I love the coziness of this place with needle point dog pillows, walls plastered with dog paintings and a cool green chandeliers over the bar. Also LOVE the organic local options. So glad there is a suburban location of this iconic, Philly institution.
14471	3839	4.0	1	2013-12-31	It was ok. The butter pasta looked like it had a whole stick of butter in it, but otherwise it was good. The beet and pomegranate punch was sour, but if you add some sugar, it's good. The avocado blt was really good. The cheese burger should get 3 stars, my brother told me. The mushroom omelet gets 4 stars, said my dad. The service was good, though. Great place to eat.
13629	3839	4.0	1	2013-12-30	I've been here for brunch a number of times, and White Dog has never disappointed. I enjoy the fact that they update the menu every season - there are always refreshing new dishes, but the ones that stay on the menu are pretty golden. For brunch, the kennett square omelet is really good! I enjoy the arugula salad and the spiced potatoes with sauteed bell peppers that are served on the side. The tuna tartare is refreshing, but if you're going for something filling, I wouldn't recommend this. Eggs benedict is what you'd expect, although I've heard the biscuits can be a bit dry sometimes. Overall, decent ambiance and waitstaff. You can ask for as much bread and butter as you want.
14472	3839	4.0	1	2013-12-22	Review Summary: Ambience: 4/5    Food: 4.5/5    Service: 4/5 I had brunch with my friends here and had a wonderful time! The decor was really quaint and homey, the service equally welcoming. Although the entrance was narrow this place seemed to continue on forever in an endless maze of corridors and rooms. I ordered the Koch Farm Turkey Cobb Salad, which was really large and came with numerous toppings neatly arranged around the greens. This was both visually appealing and also a pleasure to eat, because I was able to apportion the toppings with every mouthful to my desire, instead of eating them all at once. The light hollandaise dressing was delightful and they really did NOT skimp on the turkey. All in all, a great dish! My friends got the Maryland Crab Eggs Benedict, Kennett Square Mushroom Tart, and the Braised Green Meadow Farm Beef Brisket. They all thoroughly enjoyed their dishes, though the beef brisket did come with a side dish called chilaquiles which both smelled and tasted like boiled nachos. It was not terribly pricey for a brunch place, I paid $18 with tip and tax. Bear in mind dinner might be a totally different story; I came here last valentine's day and they only had set menus that were $60 per person. Would definitely come for brunch again!
14473	3839	3.0	1	2013-12-20	Got off my flight and needed a quick bite before embarking on my endeavors around the city. Was recommended to this place by the shuttle driver who drove me from the airport to the hotel. Ordered the tofu bell pepper quiche, which included a light salad on the side. Food: 5 star quality. Freshly made with fresh and seasonal ingredients. Very delicious. Environment: Very comfortable, and the entire decor made it as if I was eating at home. Price: Expensive for how much I got. The quiche was a fist and half in size. The salad was equal in size. The bill: $14 pre-tax. I left hungry.
11620	3839	4.0	1	2013-12-19	The only thing I didnt like was the seat I was seated in. My legs were too Long and the table too short to comfortably cross them. Other than that, this was a superb experience. Our waiter reminded me of Truman Capote. Polite and professional. I got the Rum & Rootbeer. Anything with Art in the Age is worth it. Get the brussel sprouts!!!! The maple syrup adds another dimension. House made linguine with mushroom pesto and lamb sliders: YUM. My boyfriend (who was celebrating his 26th bday) got chicken with really good mashed potatoes and most delicious mushroom florets I've ever had raw(ish). Cool decor and dog theme.
14474	3839	5.0	1	2013-12-15	Everything was delicious! We did the trasting menu. It was four courses and for $15 we also added on the alcohol pairing. Absolutely no complaints. The atmosphere is quaint and charming and server was excellent. I will definitely be going back!
14475	3839	4.0	1	2013-12-11	1.) Friendly service (and made sure my mimosa glass was always full) 2.) Adorable, cozy atmosphere. 3.) Delicious brunch! I had zero trouble making a reservation for 10 for Sunday brunch. It was really nice to receive a confirmation call from the restaurant the day before my reservation. Due to the snowy weather though, only 4 guests showed up but the hosting staff acted quickly with getting a more suitable table for our party size. The restaurant was decorated for the holidays and the whole place was really charming. The pastries and bread that come out with brunch are a great touch and $12 unlimited mimosas, blood Mary's or greyhounds with your meal is WONDERFUL!! Food was served hot and in a timely fashion. Country fried steak topped with a sunny-side-up egg with sweet potato mash is so tasty. Overall, really great experience and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Looking forward to visiting their Wayne location!
14476	3839	5.0	1	2013-12-07	I love this place. I have been with my friends and my family. This place has a fantastic happy hour with half priced drinks and apps at the bar. The food is incredible (on-par with the best gastro-pub food you've ever had) and the service is fast and friendly. Any time, any table you'll get great food and great service. Try the Kobe Beef sliders, the Truffle Butter fries and the Chacouterie Cheese Platter and enjoy some of the fresh draught Yuengling (all half price at happy hour). Every time I go near Philadelphia I find myself drawn here.
14477	3839	5.0	1	2013-12-02	Was in Philadelphia recently for a wedding and stayed near the UPenn campus. While strolling around the day before the ceremony we stumbled into White Dog and discovered a hidden gem.  Our first visit was somewhat rushed and limited to one appetizer and a glass of wine.  That app was the fried oysters which were absolutely divine, the batter and caviar topping we're remarkably complimentary and I would highly recommend this. Being so enamored with our initial visit we convinced a couple friends to join us for brunch Sunday after the wedding. If I remember right the four of is had a burger, the lamb bolognese, biscuits and gravy, and the brisket.  We couldn't help but eat off each other's plates and all items were DELICIOUS. Prior to our meal we had the smoked salmon as an appetizer and it was also amazing. All in all, I highly recommend White Dog for a full meal or just to stop by for a drink.
14478	3839	4.0	1	2013-11-19	I love White Dog. It's my favorite place to meet friends for Happy Hour ($5 glasses of good wine, $3 craft beers) and delicious $3-5 dishes that are scaled down versions of the restaurant's signature food. The service is almost always great.
14479	3839	5.0	1	2013-11-16	"Our second visit to White Dog.  At the risk of arrogance, this is a world class restaurant. The food is excellent. Service fantastic.  Maggie has returned to serving and was wonderful. We had all the pastas, Tortellini and Ahi Tartare as appetizers. Scottish salmon.  Recommendation for the Trefethen blend and the ""OPP"" Oregon Pinot.  Great. Busy but worthy it.  Have wine on the patio, chill and enjoy."
14480	3839	5.0	1	2013-11-16	We came to the café last night and had Maggie as our server- she was PERFECTION. Our family is full of self proclaimed wine snobs- she recommended two separate bottles to us that were both absolutely incredible. She was charming, funny, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu in its entirety (food, wine, dessert, etc). The food was wonderful, but even if it wasn't I would come back solely for the astounding service that Maggie offered us- she is an absolute gift. Well done, White Dog Café!
14481	3839	5.0	1	2013-11-15	They change menus frequently
14482	3839	4.0	1	2013-11-13	Definitely a great spot. Wonderful atmosphere and location. My friend and I shared a plate of the Yellowfin Tartare and it was delicious. For my entree, I got the scallops and it was mediocre. I thought that the scallops were a bit bland and could have been flared with more flavors. My friend enjoyed her linguine so much she didn't stop to come up for air! Service was good. Our waiter did take quite a while to take our orders, but he did apologize for it because it was very busy on a Tuesday night. Overall, a wonderful experience and I will definitely be returning.
14483	3839	4.0	1	2013-11-05	The tofu was decent. The steak and pasta were tasty, and the service was above par.
8337	3839	2.0	1	2013-10-31	"I came to White Dog Cafe with several (7) co-workers for lunch. The first thing I noticed was the high menu prices for lunch. Oh well, I don't mind paying for quality/local food. I was excited to hear that the special of the day was an avocado BLT. Several of us ordered it, much to our disappointment. Of the 4 of us who ordered it, none of us was pleased. I literally had two ENTIRE strips of bacon that were PURE fat without smidgen of meat. I took a photo because it was so appalling, but I will not post it to Yelp. I cannot believe a chef would actually put that on a plate. It took everything in me not to gag as I picked entire bites full of fat out of my mouth. They also added an egg to the sandwich, which the waitress did not mention so the others (not me) were picking that off. Other people seemed somewhat happy with their meals (though quite surprised when the bill came), but the bacon in the sandwiches was truly inexcusable. Also, the server stood at one end of the table to take our orders and we were literally screaming so she could hear us. Would it have been so much of a hassle to walk around the table rather than repeatedly saying, ""What did you say? Sorry I can't hear you. What?"""
14484	3839	3.0	1	2013-10-25	The food is good but I don't think it's worth the price :(
14485	3839	5.0	1	2013-10-23	Loved this quaint spot near Penn's campus for local, sustainable, (and whenever possible) organic cuisine. I had a work dinner here, and so we were in our own separate room (maxed out at 13), but there was still plenty of noise and activity from the main rooms. We started out with drinks, and I love there large local Craft Beer List. whitedog.com/uploads/uci… I had the Ithaca Country Pumpkin ale, and later the limited-to-local-only Dock Street Rye IPA. Both beers were good, especially the Dock Street. The servers were really up on their wine and beers, and also knew the main menu really well. For the group we had two Pennsylvania cheese plates, and I loved the cheese that was wrapped in a Sycamore leaf. Eats shoots and leaves! (No commas needed). For my meal: - Lancaster Apple Pumpkin Bisque, poured over Mascarpone and candied Walnuts. If you could capture autumn in a bisque, this would be that! It was amazing. There were just too many good entrees on the menu, but I chose: - Spicy Lamb Bolognese Rigatoni. Very good, although a bit rich for my tastes. This paired well with my RyeIPA, or red wine would have been good too. This is a good place for a group, a date (who's a liberal or watched Portlandia and gets into sustainable things), impressing museum docents, or mom and dad who are paying for your education, etc. Oh, and don't forget to visit the nicely decorated bathrooms downstairs for a unique use of tree wood as a sink.
14486	3839	2.0	1	2013-10-21	I live in the suburbs and eat at the White Dog in Wayne often. The experience is always perfect. For my boyfriend's birthday we decided to try the University City location. Our waiter was the WORST. He made our dinner awkward and uptight by making us feel stupid when we asked any questions regarding menu items. My burger was fine but I'm not positive it was cooked fully. Do not ever need to go back and will stick to Wayne White Dog!
14487	3839	4.0	1	2013-10-13	Nice lunch for a rainy day.  Sat at the bar where you receive a discount off your meal.  The Vegan Pad Thai Salad was very delicious.  Hummus Wrap was served warm and very tasty and large enough for two meals.  They had a kids-friendly menu which served decent chicken fingers and fries.  Overall a good choice. Just as a footnote.  We've been coming here regularly some time ago and gone are the simpler days.  I longed for grilled brie on a toasted French baguette.  No more live piano music in the dining room.  Looked like the store is gone too.  The area has changed a bit.  All but wonderful memories now.
14488	3839	4.0	1	2013-10-12	Great spot from start to finish. The food was delicious. Pear Salad and Steak Frites = Awesomeness!
14489	3839	3.0	1	2013-10-11	I went with a friend for lunch. First off, the beer list wasn't up-to-date; not a big deal but shows lack of attention. As far as food, I paid $20 for two items. First, five of the TINIEST fried oysters one could ever imagine--is it legal to harvest oysters that are so small, or is the kitchen cutting normal-size oysters into thirds? There was too much coating for the tiny oysters, but even with that it amounted to five little bites. With so much coating they seemed dry and the little bit of aioli with them was--well, a really little bit.  The caviar was a few specks on each oyster. It is an appetizer, but I'd expect a bit more food for the price. I know I should stick to the here-and-now, but I can't help remembering a fabulous fried oyster entree at the White Dog back in the day.  The second item was a side of butternut squash, exceptionally good; possibly the best winter squash I've ever had, which is saying a lot. A bit pricey for a side at lunch, but it was a decent-size portion and for the quality I didn't mind the price. Could have made a meal of it! My friend had Pad Thai, which she described as tasteless. I tried it; wouldn't quite say say tasteless but it  was bland. Soba noodles in Pad Thai seemed odd, but these noodles looked more like a whole-grain spaghetti than soba. It was a small portion and certainly overpriced at $14. I could make better Pad Thai at home. Fortunately my friend wasn't very hungry; I hadn't been hugely hungry before lunch, but I left the restaurant hungry and stopped by Dunkin' Donuts on  the way back to work. And I'm not planning to go back to the White Dog, which I think is riding on its reputation from years past plus its Penn Campus location.
14490	3839	5.0	1	2013-10-04	So good.
14491	3839	5.0	1	2013-10-03	The White Dog is amazing!! I got the burger and it was so huge that it probably could have been for like two people. The french toast was a little too heavy and sweet, but it also was huge.
14492	3839	5.0	1	2013-09-30	I NEED to come back here. Everything was so delicious, the cocktails were amazing, the outside seating was insanely adorable. It was also a wonderfully beautiful day, so that also aided in our experience. For my meal I ordered the ribeye cheesesteak, the bun was toasted, the onions added a pleasant sweetness...BUT THOSE FRIES. heaven. Nice and crispy, lightly drizzled with truffle oil, there was also some kind of cheese and herb lightly sprinkled on top. yum. Despite all this I still wish I had gotten the crab cake BLT, but i refrained bc my bf is kosher and I wanted to share :3 His dish, the bolognese was out of this world scrumptious, I could easily imagine seeing it on the menu of a michelin starred restaurant. The basil ricotta really lightened the dish, and helped ease over the spiciness of the dish.   We got a side of mushrooms, and I was surprised when I saw some gnocchi mixed in. Even more surprised when I tried them. Truly the lightest, fluffiest gnocchi I've ever tasted. So good. boyf says: went for lunch and it was fucking splendid. beautiful atmosphere inside and out. service was a bit slow, but after seeing how packed it was, i forgave it for the most part (still deducting 0.25 stars). our waiter was very helpful though. the hibiscus margarita i had was light and refreshing, yet somehow not weak on the alcohol. i had the rigatoni with lamb bolognese, crushed tomatoes, spinach and basil ricotta, along with a side of sauteed mushrooms mixed with some gnocchi. the rigatoni dish was face-meltingly delicious. i don't think i've ever had a pasta & meat dish this good in my life. the basil ricotta and spinach really brightened up this main as well. would eat over and over and over again. the side of sauteed mushrooms and gnocchi was fantastic too, with the gnocchi being cooked perfectly. also sampled some of the girlfriend's dry-aged ribeye cheesesteak and out of the three cheesesteaks i've had in my life (the other two being from halal carts in nyc), this was clearly the best. in its own right though, yes, it was juicy, moist and delectable. would go here again at any time of the day. a great experience. overall, 4.75 stars.
10199	3839	4.0	1	2013-09-29	I'm not usually a brunch person but some friends suggested meeting for brunch near their hotel in University City. I hadn't been to the White Dog in years, but it was just as good if not better than remembered. Loved the stuffed French toast. I am a tea drinker and I appreciated the wide selection of teas. I will return here to treat my student to brunch another day!
11636	3839	4.0	1	2013-09-27	White Dog Cafe was purely delicious, completely seasonal, and very cute and cozy. I love that the food is farm to table fresh, and the menu is unique and exciting. I had the Butternut Squash & Sage flatbread and it was pizza a la autumn if there ever was one! I had a taste of the truffle fries...heaven! My only complaint was that it felt a bit cramped, and the prices were a little high. Overall a great spot to take clients or family. I will definitely return!
14493	3839	3.0	1	2013-09-18	"I was recommended to White Dog along the lines of ""Have you been there yet"" so I decided to try my hand. I can't say that I had extensive experience, but I thought the food was pretty good: the bread was freshly baked, and my salad was not overly dressed and had a good balance of flavors. However, I feel like the food itself was undercut by the decor. I feel like the decorations went past ornate, and went over the top to ostentatious to the point where the ""cafe"" feels stuffy. I would rather they use the frippery to balance the food cost. I would rate the food around 4 stars, but the decor and prices seem to drop it one star."
8489	3839	3.0	1	2013-09-09	My boyfriend and I went here for a dinner. I wasn't starving, so I got 2 small plates--the bison burger sliders and the Bruno Bros. grilled peach burrata. I didn't actually know what burrata was when I ordered it, but I rarely meet a cheese I don't like. It was presented almost like a salad, with some sort of green, cheese, grilled peaches, and proscuitto. It was a nice combination, and I don't really like salad, so that's saying a lot. The bison burger sliders, of which you get 2, are AMAZING. My eyes were wide, my hands were flailing, and I was probably drooling as I ate them  , trying to understand how something could taste so delicious (my boyfriend would argue that this is why we can't go nice places). Speaking of which, boyfriend had the porter house pork, which he seemed to like. He also ordered truffle fries, but they never actually appeared. It was fine because we weren't charged for them, and we don't really make a big stink about mistakes like that. I had the Reisling, as well, which was good but not my favorite. We didn't get dessert because it was all pretty healthy and boring sounding. The only major downside was that it was too loud in the dining room, so next time I'll try to request a quieter locale. There are a couple rooms to the restaurant, so it might be quieter in some sections. This was a nice meal, closer to 3.5 stars, mainly because DAMN, those bison burgers were bangin'.
14494	3839	4.0	1	2013-09-08	A good place near UPenn where everything is farm-to-table.  The service can be a little uneven, but the food is good.
14495	3839	4.0	1	2013-09-02	"One of the few restaurants on Penn's campus that I would consider ""classy"" enough to take my parents out to when they come to visit. The restaurant itself is quaint and decorated to give off a down-to-earth, homey feel, but the dining experience is designed to be more high-end and up-scale. Food-wise, I highly recommend the beef tenderloin. Beautifully presented, the meat was tender, perfectly cooked, and incredibly easy to cut. Seriously, it was like using a hot knife on butter. The mashed potatoes were light and fluffy, but they still retained a rich, buttery flavor. The taste of the bleu cheese is incredibly strong in this dish, but since I'm a big fan of bleu cheese, that suited me just fine. I did find the flavor profile for this dish as a whole to be a little bit unusual, as the bleu cheese didn't really seem to fit in with the rest of the dish, but the overall result was still incredibly tasty. There's nothing incredible or special about the tuna tartare, but it did serve as a decent appetizer to start everyone off. I'm not really sure why, but one of my favorite things about White Dog is that they serve sodas in mason jars. I guess it's just a little touch of creativity that I appreciated. In terms of service, our waiter was polite and accommodating, but he did not seem particularly invested in serving our table. Not only did we have to remind him that half of us had not received our drinks yet, but he also didn't give us bread until we specifically asked for it halfway through the meal. Looking at his other tables, we noticed that he offered them all bread (without being asked) soon after they sat down. Why were we treated differently? None of this really negatively impacted our dining experience, but the service definitely could have been a little bit better. Overall, White Dog Cafe offers a pleasant and enjoyable up-scale dining experience on Penn's campus. Pro tip: When I checked into this restaurant on Yelp, I got a free draft beer!"
14496	3839	3.0	1	2013-08-21	I came here for lunch one day with my colleagues. I got the turkey burger. Yum! It was one of the best turkey burgers I have ever had. It was flavorful and juicy. Sometimes turkey burgers get hard and dry but this was tender. The service was quick. I was out within 40 minutes. The only thing is the restaurant is on the pricier side.
14497	3839	5.0	1	2013-08-17	This is a wonderful, cozy place.  I have eaten here twice so far with my Art Gal group visiting from Washington, DC.  I love the local, organic, sustainable focus.  The food is fantastic.  I'm a vegetarian and there was plenty for me to choose from.  This time I had a wonderful tofu dish.  The wait staff is friendly and helpful.  Plus, restaurant is within easy walking distance to 30th St Station for our train back to DC.  We will return!
8375	3839	3.0	1	2013-08-13	I was really excited about venturing across the river for Dining Days. The pre posted menu had me salivating and i already knew what i wanted before i even arrived. Bonus points for the free beverage with a yelp check in.   Though my meal was around 3.5 stars i chose to round down due to timing of everything. Each course took a little bit longer to receive making this a 2 hour dinner. I wouldn't have minded but the restaurant was pretty dead. I would probably consider trying white dog again if i have a few hours to kill.
14498	3839	4.0	1	2013-08-08	This place has a great happy hour! Their amazing tuna tartare, which is normally $14, is only $5 (and didn't seem any smaller in size, or less delicious). Such a deal. I also tried bison for the first time here in the form of their bison sliders and they were soo good (and also only $5). Their burgers were huge and looked yummy, too. They have a nice beer selection that's half-off during happy hour, which translates to somewhere from $2.50-$3.50 each. ---- The first time I came here was actually for a real dinner, and I had the tuna tartare (which was amazing then, too, just pricey) and a pesto pasta dish which I can't remember the name of. The dish was okay. It seemed to be lacking in flavor to me, which is strange because I normally love pesto. It wasn't bad by any means, just bland. Salt helped a little, but it was not something I would order again. I will note that my roommate seemed very satisfied with her dish. I tried some of hers as well - it was very good. I don't know how often I'll be coming here for dinner (read: not often because I'm a poor student), but their happy hour is definitely something I'll be coming back to. But I've heard their brunch is bangin' as well... may have to check it out sometime.
14499	3839	3.0	1	2013-08-02	Meh... The ketchup is amazing?? Seemed like it was straight up Heinz.  These are not the local ingredients you are looking for... Especially at these prices. It seems like it would be a nice place, but honestly I wasn't feeling it.  For LA prices, I expect a certain level of food quality, and frankly it just wasn't there for what I ordered.  One of my drinks was from a 'can'?  This place either needs to go gastropub and drop the prices or step their game up and deliver higher quality with real local homemade ingredients.  The staff were nice, so I bumped it an extra star for that.
14500	3839	5.0	1	2013-08-02	"Had lunch there when I visited UPenn. Very good environment. They have a theme of ""dogs"", which is very adorable. Food is authentic and of good quality. Will def go back for dinner next time."
14501	3839	5.0	1	2013-08-01	Fantastic restaurant! My family has eaten here a number of times and the food is always good. We have tried breakfast, lunch and dinner. Always a variety and always interesting, fresh & delicious. Definitely a favorite.
14502	3839	2.0	1	2013-07-29	Atmosphere: 1.5 Service: 4 Food: 2 Went for Dining Days and tried the prix fixe menu.  First off, this place has a slight hint of public restroom smell - like the weird sweet smell of blue toilet bowl tablets.  Not a great start.  The interior looks old and tired.  Frayed carpet (who has a carpeted dining room?), lacey window treatments, not impressed. The first two courses were good.  Gazpacho was very tasty with a hint of spice.  The carpaccio was good, although the lemon oil, capers, goat cheese, etc completely overwhelmed any beef flavor.   The salads were fine, although microscopic.  The peach salad had 2 peach wedges, 4 blueberries, 1 cherry, and 3 small arugula leafs.  The watermelon salad was better, but about 3-4 small bites of food as well. The main courses were WAY below what I would expect from a restaurant of this price.  The 'berkshire pork'  that was served was not at all what was described on the menu.  Now, as I am writing this review and looking back at the menu, I wished I had asked to look at the menu again because I did not receive the dish that I ordered, but assumed it was my mistake and am not one to make a scene.  My dish included 2-3 ounces of pork with no sauce, glaze, anything and a salad of only frisee and 2 green beans sliced lengthwise with lemon vinaigrette.  It was 5 bites of food.  My partner's spicy bolognese was better, but still noting special.  The pasta was from a box. The deserts were an assortment of three small bites (noticing a theme?).  One was a wedding type cookie with jelly on top, one was a graham cracker type cookie with blueberry, I didn't try the third. Overall I can say we will NOT be returning to White Dog and it will not be recommended to others.  For $125 for two with 3 beers I was totally underwhelmed, left hungry and feeling ripped off.
11677	3839	5.0	1	2013-07-27	My boyfriend and I stopped in to White Dog on 7/25 before our show at the Mann Center. Though it was currently Dining Days, we declined because it's $35 a person and we were looking for something slightly cheaper. We were seated in a very romantic and pretty little room, and though our server was attentive, he wasn't very personable. In fact, the last time we came to White Dog was for brunch, which was very good but the server was just meh. I'm not sure whats' up with White Dog's staff - either they are VERY good or poor. For example, our server didn't talk to us. At all. He filled our water glasses, took our order. Pretty much it. The server tending to the older couple behind us went into the dinner specials and talked at great length what was in every dish they were interested in and even shared some stories. I was insanely jealous because that server was AWESOME. The five stars here is for the FOOD. I ordered the organic tofu, which comes plated with a carrot-ginger puree, some sort of white raisin chutney and roasted carrots. It was VERY delicious! I could have licked my plate if it wasn't so full from the other things we had. My boyfriend ordered the Spaghettini, which was noodles with pesto, laughing bird shrimp, crab meat and heirloom tomatoes. Everything about this dish was divine and he shared quite a bit with me because it was such a large plate of pasta. Mmm-mmm! And the truffle Parmesan fries were also very, very good with the aioli dipping sauce. I highly recommend them! Overall, I will continue going to White Dog Cafe despite the so-so service because the food is super good and the decor is very nice. I like it here.
10244	3839	4.0	1	2013-07-22	amazing brunch. you feel very fancy and the service is great. Though I think their tables are too small and they have too many decorations. last time, I had their fried egg sandwich which was super tasty. definitely all of my calories for the whole day, but good.
14503	3839	4.0	1	2013-07-18	We wandered in here looking for a drink to cool down from the incredibly hot weather, and White Dog fulfilled our needs. Drinks were a bit pricey but what do you expect from an on-campus bar/restaurant. My friend ordered a mixed drink and I enjoyed my first Sly Fox. We also shared an order of the vegan coconut creme brulee which was absolutely divine, I would definitely order that again. I think its a nice place to go have a drink and relax, though their music selection could be improved (Lady Gaga album, really?).
14504	3839	4.0	1	2013-07-18	Above everything else and while the food was delicious, our waiter was top notch.  He knew the menu extremely well, paced our service just right and was not pushy with upselling.  I just thought he nailed it on the head. The cheese and meat boards were divine and I loved being able to choose the cheese sampling. I went with the chicken and mash which was not too rich even though it was wrapped in proscuitto.  My mom and boyfriend had the wasabi crusted salmon which was also cooked to perfection and a good portion. I love that the menu offers half and full sizes and the wine/beer list has a wide variety.  Definitely a do-over!
14505	3839	4.0	1	2013-07-16	Man, if someone else was buying, I'd eat at White Dog Cafe every day of the week. While too expensive for me to dine here regularly, I will undoubtedly be back here when my girlfriend and I feel like splurging a bit on a good meal. And honestly, I'd rather pay top dollar prices at a place like the White Dog because you're really paying to support the sourcing of local food. The beef tartare is a beautifully composed appetizer that comes with a cracked quail egg for you to pour on top of the meat. Very well seasoned and accompanied by purple mustard and half a baguettte's worth of crostini, this is how tartare should be done. I ordered the dry aged ribeye cheesesteak, which is hands down the best cheesesteak I've ever had. Seriously, they put some sort of crack mushrooms in there because I've been craving that sandwich ever since we ate there last month. Great local cheese selection and stellar desserts. My girlfriend got the coconut creme brulee, which was perfectly cooked with a light char on top and creamy inside. I got the chocolate cake with chocolate mousse, filling, and ice cream, which was insanely rich and enjoyable. Paired with a Pedro Ximenez sherry... life doesn't get much better than that. Our server was awesome -- friendly, attentive without being overbearing, just excellent. Loved it!
14506	3839	3.0	1	2013-07-16	Hooorraayy! Windows Phone app can finally write reviews! Now down to business. I stop by the charming little row of restaurants  after a visit to the Penn Muesum. My girlfriend and I decide to stop by the white dog cafe to take advantage of a checkin deal. Although the free beer was great. Everything else was entirely overpriced. Yes the food was good but the depending on what size plates you order. It is miniature , tiny, and small. All of the ingredients are local and fresh. However, no one could tell me if there pork products had nitrates in them. If you pride yourself on using fresh and local and depend a higher price it seems irrational to have nitrates to cheaply cure your meats. Lastly our waiter was a nice man but seem to lack focus on us because we weren't middle aged Penn alumni.
14507	3839	5.0	1	2013-07-15	Very good. Great brew (Yards Saison), great burrata, and really great gnocchi.
14508	3839	3.0	1	2013-07-09	The food was good, but not astounding, especially given the prices. I'm assuming the increased cost of buying only quality local ingredients adds to that. The bathrooms are in need of some cleaning up/renovations, but the waitress mentioned that major renovations are coming soon for the entire restaurant. Fortunately, she said that they will not be changing the overall cozy feel of the place, which is one of the fun aspects to eating there. As for service, it was great.
14509	3839	4.0	1	2013-07-03	This was another place in Philly that was recommended to me. I have to say, I loved what I ordered. Although it was a little pricey and the food portion were rather small, I actually was filled to the brim by the time we finished and all was said and done. I ordered the Gnocchi, which came out super fresh and home made. It was literally melt in your mouth type pasta where it literally melted in your mouth. The flavors were just great. I ordered a margarita, which was healthy and strong to taste. For desert, we got the warm blueberry tart, which was so soft and fresh. I loved the confusing layout of the restaurant because it felt like we were really eating at someone's dog decorated house. Make sure you go downstairs and use the bathrooms!
14510	3839	4.0	1	2013-06-26	Came here with clients.  They picked so I will give the credit to them. I actually used to live above the restaurant when I was in college.  The entire street is completely changed - it's a row of restaurants.   They have many rooms so you can get lost easily :).  I can see it being a very romantic spot for a date. The beef tartar - came with the quail egg on top.  I loved it!!!  Perfect amount of mustard and capers.  It didn't come with toast which was a little strange but when I asked for toasts, they arrived in no time so maybe the waiter just forgot. The quinoa scallop salad - not a big fan of the greens they have in there, a bit too bitter.  They put at least 4 plump scallops so worth the $18 price tag. Service was prompt - we were in and out in 1.5 hrs. Overall a great experience so I wouldn't mind coming back there again for another client meeting.
14511	3839	3.0	1	2013-06-26	"We were a group of seven and the food was absolutely delicious all around. So, why the three stars?  Well, when we arrived at 11:30 a.m., the service was terrific.  We were warmly greeted and the hostess quickly added a seventh seat to the table we had reserved for six.  Our waiter was very friendly, delivered our beverages and made suggestions about what dishes he particularly enjoys. Somehow (and, really, I am not hallucinating because I checked back), I got an old menu that listed a different set of ingredients for a salad that they still offer with the same name but a different set of ingredients.  Of course, that happened to be the salad I ordered.  When I brought this to the waiter's attention after the first few bites, he was apologetic and offered to bring me a different salad.  I said it wouldn't be worth the time and effort since the salad I got was pretty good and I didn't want to hold up my dining companions.  I suggested a free dessert instead to which the waiter readily assented. When I went out to check the stack of menus again, I was intercepted by the manager who engaged me in conversation about the problem.  To say he was officious is an understatement.  He argued with me and said it was his ""operational"" decision whether to replace the salad or provide a free dessert.  And here I was thinking I'd saved the waiter and the restaurant aggravation and expense.  Oh well, I guess no good deed goes unpunished. After the main courses were delivered, the waiter got another large party and it was very difficult to get attentive service.  And, I must admit, that the manager's remarks really ticked me off. So, while the food was fabulous, the overall meal (for me at least) ended up leaving a metaphorical bad taste in my mouth."
14512	3839	5.0	1	2013-06-25	We sat outside and the ambience is beautiful. Food and booze were equally good. Great wait staff. Restaurant is on a quiet street and outdoor seating is pet friendly.
14513	3839	1.0	1	2013-06-21	Completely not worth the price! I am not sure how the bill for three people was almost $100 for lunch! Extremely overpriced and overrated. The service was poor and the salad with strawberries consisted of a handful of arugula with two strawberries. Do not plan on ever going back. We left hungrier than before we arrived
7053	3839	3.0	1	2013-06-07	White dog has its own style, which I can respect. I have had their version of grilled cheese before, which is very hearty and nice. Be prepared to wait however, it isn't the fastest place.
14514	3839	4.0	1	2013-06-05	This is one of my favorite restaurants so far in Philly. They have two menus: one which is a very fancy dinner menu, and one which is more of a cafe menu. Both are on the expensive side for a grad student, but the second option is doable for a nice dinner out with friends, especially if it's during happy hour as they have drink and food specials. The first option is great if you are going for a nice family meal with your parents. Make sure to ask for the cafe menu if you don't want to be seated in the fancier section. I appreciate that they have a lot of locally-sourced produce, meat and cheese on their menu. Also, the beer selection is great. All the food I've had here has been absolutely delicious. I also love the decor and atmosphere. Overall, I think this is an often-overlooked gem, written off by many for a reputation of being too pricey, but really the less-expensive cafe menu is not unreasonable and offers some of the best food in the neighborhood.
14515	3839	4.0	1	2013-05-29	I can't believe I've never reviewed this place! We eat here almost every time we come to visit friends in Philly and it's our favorite brunch spot. The menu has changed every time, but the most recent dish I had was a kind of like a scrapple breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese and house pickled red onions. It was served with truffle fries. Oh my gosh, their scrapple is amazing. We had it once before so I knew it was going to be good. I don't know what they put it in (nor do I want to know). This was a special but they should definitely put it on their regular menu. And you can't beat their bloody mary and mimosa special!
14516	3839	2.0	1	2013-05-28	I used to be a huge fan of the White Dog.  Seriously, I grew up in West Philly and this was always where we went for celebratory dinners and nice nights out.  The lamb bolognese is consistently delicious and I once had a burger here that was TO DIE FOR.  Their soups are usually fresh and delicious and the garlic fries used to be my main go-to. Unfortunately, I do not think I will be returning.  There appears to have been a HUGE price hike in the last few months that have turned this nicer establishment to only for the law/wharton folks across the street.  But really, a 17$ cheeseburger? Are you kidding me?? I remember LAST year when the burger was 14$(cheaper! during happy hour! which they don't even OFFER anymore!!). What happened??? It's just disappointing.  I'm guessing they had to increase the price by 20% just to be able to afford the absurdly ostentatious WOODEN menus that are really the most obnoxious things I've ever seen.  What was once a nice place to get locally made food has now established itself as a venue for a small select group of of rich penn peeps.  I'd take a food truck any day.
10282	3839	3.0	1	2013-05-27	"While White Dog's brunch food earns a spot among the city's best, the steep prices will keep me from coming back frequently. On the plus side, there was no wait during Saturday peak hours. Also, our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Our coffee and water cups were kept full and he offered good menu suggestions when needed. My pancakes were among the best I've had in the city. I received four thick, fluffy discs about 3"" in diameter that had a pleasant buttermilk tang. The toppings, citrusy quince jam, vanilla cream, and almonds, were subtle and enhanced the pancakes' flavor rather than overshadowing it. The side of house made sausage was a bit too sweet for my liking yet had a fresh, porky taste. A croque benedict was scant in portion but rich with crispy brioche and hollandaise. Unfortunately, the portions ran small and the prices were high. The damage per person was around $20, and would've been markedly more if we boozed. With bruncheries around the city serving up gargantuan portions at significantly less cost than White Dog, the bill was a big deterrent for our return. Still, White Dog has likely the best brunch food in University City and stands toe-to-toe with other popular brunch places around the city. Just don't expect to get any sort of bang for your buck."
14517	3839	4.0	1	2013-05-26	Went for brunch the first time today and it was a lovely place to linger on a Sunday morning.  We lucked out with the lack of crowds so the waitstaff had plenty of capacity to be attentive, but I can see how it can become crazy during a peak rush. The unlimited mimosa was tasty and made with quality ingredients.  While I was temped by the french toast, the crab frittata was a good savory choice. The stack burger looked amazing and it's accompanying fries were really good. The chocolate chip cannoli was a great ending.
14518	3839	3.0	1	2013-05-20	My friends ordered burger stacks (burgers with 2 patties), which they said were very good. I wasn't hungry enough for a full entree, so I got the following: * Mushroom soup with Amish chicken and truffle creme fraiche - $9 The soup was brought in a little pitcher and poured into the bowl, which was dotted with chicken and creme fraiche. The soup was an extremely thick mushroom puree. I  could barely taste the truffle. The bits of chicken were dry and didn't add much to the soup. The bowl was very shallow. * Swiss chard and beet salad, with chamomile honey dressing, goat cheese, toasted sunflower seeds - $11 A pretty and tasty salad. Also not a very large portion. Service was excellent. I liked the slate boards and chalk provided at the bar for doodling.
8316	3839	3.0	1	2013-05-15	I love the quaint setting and ambience. Food is good, but nothing spectacular. However, the dessert, sticky bourbon cake with whipped mascarpone and dates (which I was quite apprehensive to try) is now one of my all time favourites. I would go back just for that.
14519	3839	2.0	1	2013-05-14	Several people told me White Dog's a great spot to take your parents, so after graduation yesterday, we decided to try it out for a late lunch. Before I go on to the food, I'll pay the restaurant a compliment and say the decor is nice.  The location is also perfect and the service is...not bad.  I went during the post-graduation hustle, so yes, it was hectic and I'll excuse the long wait time for the food.  The host acted like a used car salesman and tried to convince us the food at White Dog was better than the surrounding locations.   The waiter we had was VERY new and made a ton of mistakes--forgetting to give us plates and bread, messing up our orders, and giving me a well-done instead of medium rare burger on top of a couple others.  The good news is that he was nice and had a great attitude.  For example, my dad ordered a blueberry lemonade but he gave us a lemon drop, which has alcohol, instead.  My dad is allergic to alcohol so it was more dramatic than you would think.  The waiter felt bad and said he would give all four of us blueberry lemonades on the house.  I appreciate the effort!  And that's why I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1. Now for the food: The items we ordered: - Cheese platter - Spicy Lamb Bolognese - Double Cheddar Burger - Beef Dip (Sandwich) - Pork Sandwich For drinks, we had: - Blueberry Lemon Drop (cocktail) - Blueberry Lemonade - Glass of Chardonnay, Patrick Thomas The food, overall, was as average as you can get.  My favorite was the cheese platter, which comes with three types of cheeses, two mustards, and jelly.  But then again, a cheese platter is hard to mess up.  The portion sizes are good--big enough to make you feel like your money wasn't completely wasted--and the lunch choices standard American fare. The double cheddar burger I had was, however, pretty unimpressive.  As I mentioned, it was already overcooked, and to make things worse, the patties were completely flavorless.  I even tried the meat by itself to see if they had given me turkey instead.  The other three entrees were mediocre, just a tiny step above Applebee's.  Sad for these prices. I didn't try any of the drinks except for the lemonade, but that was pretty bad.  Maybe it's just me, but the lemonade tasted like it had zero sugar in it--just pure lemon and water mixed with blueberry puree.  No one at my table finished it. In conclusion, I wanted to like this place.  Who wouldn't with these prices?  But next time, I think I'll just save myself 20 bucks and head to Applebee's.
14520	3839	1.0	1	2013-05-13	"Yelp, unfortunately, makes you give them at least 1 star so I will, but only for the service AFTER we complained.    When we arrived here on gradution weekend it was pretty busy (as one would assume).  We asked the host if we could sit outside and if they had service.  He said ""of course!"".  We went outside and the waiter seemed less than thrilled to help us.  We ordered our drinks and some hummus.  The hummus took about 10 minutes and the drinks 15 (way too long).  Once the rest of our party arrived we ordered.  The food took about 30 minutes so it wasn't bad.  When a girl delivered the food it's like she didnt know what the food was.  She didnt know the difference between a turkey burger and a regular burger.  I said pretty clearly that the fries were burned and she just looked at me, giggled and walked away.  My boyfriends food took about 10 more minutes to come out which is crazy...they should have held the food longer if it wasn't going to come out on time.  Once he finally got his food everything seemed OK.  Then my little sister took a bite of her turkey burger and it was completely RAW.  Extremely dangerous!  My dad had had enough and asked for the manager to come out so we could fix the problems.  The manager, hiding in the restaurant, sent the waiter back out to fix the problem instead of coming out himself and owning the problem.  We then told the waiter that we needed the manager outside immediately.  The manager came out and we told him about our problems.  He apologized once an proceeded to really do nothing.  He tried to make excuses then finally asked us what we wanted.  How professional.  He decided to buy us desserts, whatever.  The bill was brought out with the desserts still on it an the manager never cared to return and make sure our experience had been turned around.  Being a restaurant manager, I know my job is to take care of my guests and I would have gone above and beyond when problems like this occur.  He did not go above and beyond and we had to force him to help us out.  We will never be dining here again and you can bet that we will tell plenty of people about our experience."
11663	3839	5.0	1	2013-05-05	Delicious brunch, and the bottomless mimosa is a great deal. I have never been disappointed. The stuffed french toast and the steak and egg are both to die for, and the wait/bar staff is friendly and attentive. The hostesses were a little dumb, and couldn't figure out if I was allowed to make a reservation or not, and then seated a different group for my spot, but I wouldn't hold that against White Dog Cafe. The outdoor seating is gorgeous, but while the cafe provides gas heaters, they don't work (as of spring 2013) so bring a jacket if there's a breeze.
14521	3839	4.0	1	2013-05-03	I came here twice in the last week. Once for dinner and again for brunch. Sat inside for dinner and than sat outside for brunch. For dinner, I wasn't too impressed. First off the food was good. I ordered the chicken breast, which was cooked well but I wasn't blown away. The decor confused me in all honesty. It is supposed to be a cafe but had more of a tavern feel, because of the low lighting. 3/5 for dinner This spot is definitely more of a brunch location. I ordered the Benedict brioche and it was tremendous. It was probably the best thing I have ever eaten for brunch. The only reason the experience did not deserve a 5/5 is because the service can be better. Sitting outside, the waitress barely visited us and just felt eager to get rid of us. 4/5
14522	3839	4.0	1	2013-04-28	Went to White Dog Cafe since it was one of my friends favorite places, and we were celebrating his life. I had a great time here, I enjoyed the unlimited mimosas with brunch. All of the staff was very courteous and attentive. Our waitress Joan was sweet, informative, and attentive. Seemed like she was an old friend! We had a party of 15 as well so I'm surprised we didn't drive her crazy. We sat in the back on the lower level in a cozy comfortable room. The one thing I didn't like was the citrusy taste to my White Dog Salad, but the Spicy Bolognese was excellent, so creamy! I would come back here again, but I'd have to admit I probably couldn't afford it  if I was a college student. So not too many of them here, great ambience too, not noisy.
14523	3839	1.0	1	2013-04-27	The food---overpriced and barely edible. Easily the worst burger I ever had. The words 'pink slime' come to mind when describing the quality of the beef.
14524	3839	2.0	1	2013-04-22	I know I'm on UPenn campus but the prices just seem really high. I wanted to like this place. I came with some friends who recommended the restaurant and who are generally reliable for their suggestions. It was Sunday evening, so I understand places tend to understaff a little. I wasn't terribly impressed by any of the menu options for the price ($18-36 for entrées). I ended up ordering appetizers of beef tartare ($10) with fish and quail eggs as well as the bacon mac and cheese ($7). The tartar was fairly small but enjoyable, though the baguette slices didn't seem that fresh. The bacon mac was nice, with a decent cheese sauce but fairly sparse bacon bits. I tasted the beet salad and spicy lamb bolognese ($9/$21 respectively) and both were tasty but seemed a bit expensive for the quantity and quality. My friend ordered a $6 craft beer and received a hilariously tiny 4oz snifter. Onto menu humor. Rissotto. Vermecilli. Cavetelli. Accouterments (I know the dictionary says this is an alternate spelling but who uses this?) Spellcheck is a good thing. Silly thing to point out but this place seems like to wants to be a nice dining experience. Somehow, for Sunday night only one waiter was serving 6+ tables. We saw other waiters a bit earlier but they seem to have disappeared. Needless to say, it took us close to 30 minutes to get the bill and pay and two hours for the overall meal. I don't feel this is the waiter's fault specifically but that also takes away from the dining experience. Decor is pretty pleasant, though overhead lamp placement is strangely low. Decent food. Mad pricy. Slow service. I'd look elsewhere. Cheers.
14525	3839	5.0	1	2013-04-22	Super quick service.. Awesome mushroom soup. Very rich and thick. Also very interesting beet salad. Definitely a great place to eat. A little pricey, but doable for a great quality meal.
14526	3839	3.0	1	2013-04-21	"i took mushrooms before coming here and that was a very bad idea. the french toast was insane and looked like fried chicken but was very very very sweet and the disconnect between sight and taste made my head spin. the decor was bananas. dogs everywhere. looked like a movie set country club. but it was dark and air conditioned so it didn't make me feel too weirdsies. the clientele was mostly very terrible. the man behind me was huge and had a voice like james coburn. he and his mom, whose voice sounded exactly like george costanza's mom, were having a terrible conversation and it was making me anxious and sad.  ""why do people who flip burgers need health insurance?"" were the first words i heard him say. the waiter was nice but i kept having the thought that he was working there to get credit for a class. it was expensive and i just wanted to be outside. look, all i'm saying is: don't go here while you're out of your mind on mushrooms. FIN"
14527	3839	3.0	1	2013-04-19	Update: something happened to this place this fall.  On multiple occasions, the food was not that good and the service was very very slow. --- The recent rendition of this place is much better than it was in the past. Most/many of the items are well prepared.   Certainly, there are some misses but a solid option.   The ambience is ok.  It can be be noisy there (and too dark).
14528	3839	4.0	1	2013-04-05	A great place to eat in university city - great food and great beer. The only downfall is the amount of Penn/Drexel students.
6481	3839	1.0	1	2013-04-04	"There is nothing worse than leaving a restaurant hungry. This was my experience at White Dog Cafe. My boss asked to take me and my peer out to lunch and they decided on this place. I had never been so I was excited to try somewhere new on the Sansom strip that's normally packed with Drexel and PENN students after dark. My initial reaction to the decor was confusion. The place is a ""cafe"" so I thought it would have light and airy decor. Instead it was a bunch (and I mean 6 or 7) small rooms filled with dark velvet curtains, dark wood fireplaces, and an overall eclectic decor. I pushed these confused thoughts to the side and browsed the menu. For the first time in my life, nothing looked appetizing. The selection for lunch was meager at best and the menu was not very diverse.  I ended up ordering the Maryland Crab and Bibb Lettuce Salad and we ordered the Chick Pea fritters to share as an appetizer. The Chick Pea fritters were and EPIC disappointment. The 4 fritters came on a small saucer with a small drop of sauce underneath. They were overcooked, tasted like mush, very unappetizing. It was so bad that neither of us wanted the last one. Onto the main course.... or should I say the meager 3 leaves of Bibb lettuce sprinkled lightly with some crab meat. I took one look at the ""entree salad"" he put in front of me and half expected him to explain that they ran out of lettuce and crab in the kitchen, but this was not the case. While the 3 leaves of lettuce and crab were fresh, the dressing sort of ruined the dish as it was spicy which I was not expecting. It was also just not enough food. I got back to the office and had oatmeal along with a banana to hold me over until dinner. I don't recommend this place at all. With so many other options on the block, please save yourself the hunger pangs go elsewhere."
14529	3839	4.0	1	2013-04-01	Lovely food, great atmosphere, awesome 10$ drink special for brunch - unlimited mimosas! Tap water is nasty though - seriously White Dog, get a filter.
14530	3839	4.0	1	2013-03-22	great decor. good service. annoying clientele. delicious food. a little overpriced, which is why im not willing to make the trek from south philly to west philly, when i can just go to sabrinas and get overcharged for french toast.
7035	3839	4.0	1	2013-03-20	Top spot for brunch in University City. Perfect place to do some day drinking with their AYCD (all you can drink) mimosas or bottomless bloody marys. Very much a farm-to-table place. Highlights include Pork Roll and Egg sandwich and the Brunch Burger.
14531	3839	4.0	1	2013-03-12	Came here with two girlfriends for a fun night out and had a really wonderful time.  Loved the cocktails, enjoyed the cozy ambiance, and had really great service! I highly recommend the mac and cheese....which was arguably the best I've ever had.  Chris, our server, was attentive, helpful and made our evening feel as special as we wanted!
14532	3839	1.0	1	2013-03-08	10 (or was it 20 ) years back it was one of my favorite restaurant,  I have not gone back for last five years as the experience was not pleasant.  Tried again  -  just feels dated, pricey and food is very ordinary.  Not going again
8680	3839	4.0	1	2013-03-08	"When my dad comes to visit, this is his favorite place. It doesn't really have a ""cool"" vibe, more old and sophisticated which is why I don't really go here much with friends. It's also expensive, but totally worth it. As a vegetarian, the meat doesn't interest me but my dad loves it. It's great that they do all local farm ingredients. They really play that part up which is great. They have a good beer selection, and cocktails."
14533	3839	4.0	1	2013-03-02	very tasty brunch! old, old building - great use of space. love the decor.
5125	3839	2.0	1	2013-02-25	This place has terrible, terrible service. My friends and I came here one night after watching a play at Annenberg. When we arrived, the waiter yelled at us to close the door because it was cold. Yes, we understand that we should close the door, but please don't yell at us like we are kids. We then left. Next, my friends and I came here for some drinks with our professor. (Yes, our professor is that awesome!) We also had a rude waitress, who was angry with us for not giving her an exact number of the people who were coming. Our second waitress was much cheerier, so that was nice. Beets salad was refreshing and delicious. It was well seasoned too with balsamic vinegar. Hummus plate was good but nothing to get excited about. Overall, spotty service. Decent food, but a bit pricey.
10280	3839	3.0	1	2013-02-25	Been here a few times over the years. It's not the greatest food in the world, but it is nice to get fresh, locally sourced vegetables. Last time, I got the hummus plate, which was adequate, though nothing special, a bit on the dry side. Oh, the flatbread that came with it were yummy. I'd have liked to have seen some olives and vegetables with it too, though. I did get a free beer for having checked in via Yelp, though. Previous visits were similar - decent brunch and a few decent dinners, but nothing stellar.   It's extremely cramped to navigate through, but I actually like that it takes advantage of the various rooms, blending a restaurant with a home. Even though we were quite close to other tables, I didn't overhear any fun confessionals about an uncomfortable itch. I find it more intimate, charming. Bottom line - if I'm in the area and hoping to avoid the inevitable nauseous feeling I get when I shove way too much greasy food into my pie hole (which rarely ever actually has pie in it), along with a quieter environment, White Dog is an acceptable choice. But I'll never actually make a trip to University City just for this place.
14534	3839	3.0	1	2013-02-17	Here's what you need to know: - Great brunch burger, fries, and bread pudding dessert - Horrible ambiance (think a run down Cracker Barrel) - Friendly but spotty service - Pricey
14535	3839	4.0	1	2013-02-16	"went here with a group of 7 on a saturday at 11am for brunch.   made reservations earlier in the week. we were taken downstairs and they had couple tables put together for us so I guess you could say its somewhat group friendly. i felt bad though bc they basement was so small, so we sounded pretty loud. felt bad for people around us.   their menu in general is pretty pricey, but their brunch menu makes white dog cafe somewhat ""affordable"" they had bottemless mimosas and bloody mary...YES PLEASE! I had their mimosas and it was so delicious! the oj was slightly pulpy and amazing.   food: - buttermilk pancake stack: this might be the best pancake you ever have in your life. you could literally just eat the marscapone creme separately -croque monsieur benedict: they use brioche rather than the typical english muffin and I loved it! the sweetness of the break, with the saltiness of the ham, and the creamy/spicy hollandaise sauce was amazing. i love love love it. -brussel sprout omelet was good but a little bland. i dont know if I would order it again."
10845	3839	3.0	1	2013-02-04	Sabrina's was really packed for brunch so we tried White Dog. Luckily there was space in the bar area, although we were told there was a 25 min wait despite quite a few empty tables from what I saw. I've been really into Brussels sprouts lately so I got the omelet with Brussels Sprouts and caramelized onions but it was much too bland. Friend got the omelet with bacon and cheddar, and we shared home fries which were cooked with peppers & onions, providing some savoriness which was much needed. Not super impressed with brunch options but would be willing to try another meal since I like the fact that it's local/organic.
10294	3839	4.0	1	2013-01-30	"About ten months ago, I went here for a brunch and was completely disappointed. The food was OK (I remember french toast for me and an omeltte) , but service was spotty and it was an expensive brunch option. In the words of my mother, ""it was diner food, at non-diner prices"". I'm happy to report that my last meal there today was a great experience. The menu is completely revamped, and nearly every dish sounded great. I really appreciated that the vegan and vegetarian options are clearly labeled. My tofu and vegetables was delicious-the chickpeas alone were worth going back for. My companions also devoured their food, with the guest of honor even clearing his plate! I also have to mention that service was great, when we mentioned we had to be in and out within an hour. My only star taken off would be the atmosphere as the tables are kind of awkward for a large group and the lighting is kind of strange during the afternoon."
14536	3839	5.0	1	2013-01-27	The white dog is an institution.  It's been nestled just off penn campus for almost 30 years.  Fueled by an eclectic owner and a way ahead of its time philosophy, Judy wicks served up a political philosophy about community and sustainability for decades.  Her James beard award is for defining concepts like being the first business in pa to run entirely on alternative energy to mentoring Philadelphia youth into the culinary realm. Flash forward to modern day.  Judy wicks may have bowed out in lieu of moshulu helmer Marty grims and much of her eclectic fare may have gone with her but I have to say that they food has only gotten better in all my years of dining there while going to Drexel. The lamb bolognese is hands down the best pasta dish I have ever had.  It's simple, rustic and perfectly executed with a beautiful simplicity.  Visit for this dish alone and you will leave happy... And sleepy. The mushroom soup is also the best I've ever had.  They say its because the shrooms are from Kenner square.  I don't know about that but it is tasty I used to get an amazing tuna tartar that was... The best ever.  That particular incarnation is gone and the updated version falls short of the previous but I don't take points away for trying new things and the new one is still pretty good. Now that I have graduated I don't make it there as often but my most recent trip was just as amazing as I remember.  My last dinner was a delicious chicken with some sort of citrucy jus and bacon Mac and chz.  Of course it was deliciously gluttonous. Over the years I've pretty much tried everything on the menu (from the awesome local drafts to the homemade desserts and wdc never ceases to impress.  I can't recommend enough checking out this Philly gem.  The food, service and philosophy are as 5 star as it comes
14537	3839	4.0	1	2013-01-27	This was probably closer to a 3.5 but that's because I didn't enjoy my dish so much. Came here for a brunch with my parents and my impressions are: The good: Porcini-dusted tofu entrée and their omlettes The bad: Harvest quencher and French toast Must say they can prepare a darn-good vegan entree. The tofu was cooked properly and the mushrooms were a great addition. Loved the butternut squash risotto at the bottom as well. Tried a bit of the omlette and it was great, but I haven't seen lots of places really screw that up haha. Now for the Harvest Quencher. It was a  very bizarre drink. I don't think I understood it at all. And as for the French toast, I'm sure it would have been good ordinarily but they burnt my pieces which really ruined it for me. The decor was quirky, and service was good. Definitely a nice place to take your parents that's near campus.
14538	3839	4.0	1	2013-01-26	Had the Fried Green Tomato sandwich, but with smoked salmon. It was fantastic
10267	3839	3.0	1	2013-01-22	"I was extremely satisfied with my white dog dining experience... until the bill arrived.  Yes, that moment is always un-enjoyable for the diners, but what made it a turning point for this meal was realizing the price-value ratio of White Dog is just way off.  Have no fear, as our server did nothing wrong, I ensured I would not hold my shock against him.   Arriving as a pair, we enjoyed two entrees, the Lamb Bolognese and the Salmon.  Outside some slightly under-cooked pasta, both were done to our liking, but certainly not 5-star like.  The portions were also a bit on the smaller side.  As Cat D. put it, I was neither over nor under whelmed, just ""whelmed"". Back to the arrival of the bill... the total would make me believe I had an unforgettable meal, which clearly was not the case.  Was it an off-day for White Dog?"
14539	3839	5.0	1	2013-01-18	So i'm just going to get right to it: Their stewed tofu with seasonal vegetables is SO FLIPPIN' GOOD! It was a vegan dish that was so delicious, my non vegetarian/vegan grandmother said she would come back JUST TO ORDER IT AGAIN~! (as would I in a heart beat). Not a cheap lunch (which is when I was there). But they are seasonally/locally/organically focused and I think that's worth every penny. And it's nice that they really can accommodate just about every dietary request: meaty/vegan/vegetarian/gluten free etc... Cozy interior. Quirky dog art on the walls. No wonder why this place is a Philly institution. I can't wait to go back.
14540	3839	5.0	1	2013-01-15	My boyfriend and I went here for dinner the other day.  The food was... amazing.  I don't eat meat and so I stuck to the herbivore menu (I had to ask for it) and everything I had was simply delicious.  They don't have a ton of options for those who are vegetarian and the items are Tapas but I ordered four items and was totally satisfied.  I cant even tell you how the flavors came together in each dish.  I started off with the butternut squash and I don't know what they did to that squash but it was the best I have had.  I also had the hummus, vegan meatballs and eggplant.  All dishes were fantastic.  The beer selection was great with a nice variety.  My boyfriend had fish and said it was the best fish he had eaten in a very long time.  We were both blown away. The service was excellent and the atmosphere here was really nice - cozy and very rustic.  I could see myself having an anniversary dinner here.  Its laid back enough where you can dress up if you want but don't feel pressured to do so.  We spend, maybe, $70 on dinner so its pricey but in my opinion - worth the money.
11267	3839	5.0	1	2012-12-30	Excellent restaurant located across the street from U PENN dorms...My girlfriend and I went here to by pass time until dinner.  We were surprised at this neighborhood gem.  Everything was fresh and cooked to perfection.  The menu was eclectic and there were some great food combinations. My girlfriend had the peanut butter french toast...she reported that it was wonderful and the combination choices is awesome!!! Sadly, I had a migraine so i was not able to enjoy my food...but from i tasted it was great.. However when you order a mead you get unlimited specialty drinks for $10.00...
14541	3839	4.0	1	2012-12-23	I work in Center City and know all the regular places in the area we head for lunches with clients, but I was recently tasked with finding a business lunch spot in University City. I have a few co-workers who went to Penn and Drexel and when I asked them for a recommendation, they all came back with this as the first choice.  Now a few days afterwards, I think it was a great choice. As a vegetarian, I always look for variety on the menu.  They had a tofu and quinoa dish, which could have been very lackluster, but most certainly was not. A few of the people I was with had the salmon and were also very pleased. Considering we were there at noon the week before Christmas, I was expecting: a)difficulty getting a reservation; b)some delay with service.  We got neither.  It was a totally pleasant and satisfying lunch experience, though maybe a little less formal in atmosphere than a lot of the Center City business lunch spots are.  But that's totally not a knock at the White Dog - just a fact of the neighborhood. Maybe the huge wooden menus were a bit off-putting, but I understand the charm of them. If I worked with more clients in University City, I would confidently bring them here. And if I ever decide to go on a personal dining trip outside of my own neighborhood/comfort zone, I would keep this in mind.
14542	3839	4.0	1	2012-12-12	I love coming to White Dog for brunch. This place uses organic, local ingredients and on top of that, every meal I've ever had there was stellar. Its one of those places where you can't decide what to order cause everything looks so good (and it is). White Dog definitely has its own style, because the menu is so unique. if you want something new and guaranteed to be good, check it out!
14543	3839	5.0	1	2012-12-10	This was my favorite restaurant in University City when I went to college at Drexel.  True, it's a little pricey, but the food is delicious, fresh, local, and organic.  They're particularly great for brunch, but I have honestly been completely satisfied with everything I've ever gotten there.   They have a good bar, too!
14544	3839	5.0	1	2012-12-08	All local, all organic, all delicious? Heck yes! This is always where I go with my parents when they visit. Every time I've been the food is amazing, and the home made ice cream is to die for! The unique set up of the dining areas all being slightly different is such a great idea! Each room is its own dog theme, and it makes the place quieter than a one room restaurant of the same size. Its food that you feel great about eating for both the flavor and the cause its championing.
6964	3839	4.0	1	2012-11-29	This place is everything you could want from a brunch place --  comfy and cozy, friendly service and hearty food.  The crab eggs benedict I had was delicious - rich yet zesty hollandaise on egg and a hefty portion of crab.  The food is as beautiful as it is tasty.  Also, astonishingly reasonable in terms of price. The dessert menu looked phenomenal, but alas I was stuffed.  Can't wait for next time!
14545	3839	3.0	1	2012-11-28	This was my first time there, and my boyfriend's third time there. He got the burger, I got the lamb bolognese, and we split the kale salad. I noticed that our menus were different- the dandelion salad was listed on one of the menus, and the other , the kale salad. Hmm.. Salad: the tuscan kale was served in rather large pieces. The kale was rather stringy/chewy, and maybe it was a new dish, or maybe no one had tried what such large pieces tasted like. It would have been nice for the kale to have been massaged in salt first, or at least julienned. The ham was nice, but the dressing was far too sweet....it almost tasted like straight sugar to me. Burger: He ordered medium, and when the burger came out, it was definitely well done. Hmm. The waiter was nice about it, and replaced both burger and fries (that came with the order). They were pretty busy, and by the time we got the replacement burger, I was almost done with my pasta. Also, the bacon in the replacement burger was burned on the edges! Sad. The bun was not evenly warm on the replacement, either. (Maybe they aren't used to lunch being busy...? It was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.) Lamb Bolognese: Nice and kind of spicy (bf said he didn't taste the spiciness, which is odd because he has a lower spicy tolerance than I do), and al dente pasta. I liked the basil ricotta, and grana padano. The dish was also very filling, probably because it had a LOT of lamb. The lamb was only the slightest bit  (if any) gamey tasting, which I enjoyed.   The bolognese was my favorite of the three, but the poor execution of the burger and salad left me unable to rate it too high on yelp. The bf was surprised, and said that both other times he had been there, the food was on point. I might come back, but probably only if someone other than my bf treats me! :D
14546	3839	4.0	1	2012-11-28	Being a visitor who was there for a show at the nearby WCL, I decided upon making what was a wonderful nite (Shelby Lynne performed solo) even more memorable by selecting the White Dog Cafe for dinner (over two more casual restaurants that are next door on this out of the way alley).   The restaurant has a nice warm feeling though it's a bit chopped up (original walls/rooms of this row house) which in my view gives it a nice charm - for a Tuesday nite, the place was nearly full.   My wife and I loved the food; presentation, quality of the ingredients and the service was top notch.  We both had the mushroom soup with the truffle creme fraiche which was delicious and I found myself sopping up the remainder with their home made bread (a crusty sourdough type).  My bride ordered the scallops  with cauliflower and Gala apples in a spiced apple butter.  I opted for the special of the evening, a wonderfully broiled cod sitting atop parsnips & oysters in an oyster based sauce with a young celery garnish.  While I won't exactly say it is pricey, I didn't expect to be leaving the restaurant that much 'lighter' in the wallet - though that could have been a result of the wines (by the glass) that accompanied our dinner.   But all things considered, I would return if I were in the area again (and it was a special occasion) as there's no denying the quality of the food being prepared in their kitchen.
14547	3839	3.0	1	2012-11-27	Food is very good just not great considering the price.   Ambiance was enjoyable.   My wife and I had a great time here but it was just too pricey for the experience.   I will however say that the Sunday brunch was great and much more affordable...
7288	3839	4.0	1	2012-11-18	Been here for brunch a few times, definitely worth the price for some of the dishes like the waffles. Nice farmhouse style dining, a bit cramped, but will do!
11666	3839	4.0	1	2012-10-31	This is by-far one of the most underrated restaurants in town. Especially with the new chef coming on board; this place has some serious bragging to do. No where do I receive more consistent, intricate, or satisfying food at their reasonable price. Why the almost perfect score you ask? I wish I wasn't eating in my great grandmother's farm house.
14548	3839	4.0	1	2012-10-29	great lil hidden place near penn...
14549	3839	4.0	1	2012-10-25	Way late on writing my review as this was last year - but we like this place a lot. We took someone here for a very special birthday and were treated very well.  The food was excellent. Soup and cheese plate were both were great. Nice wine list. A bit pricey, but it was justified with the quality of the food. We had a bit of a mishap as we found glass in our soup and then the server spilled our wine, but even with those oddities, we still left happy... (I know, sounds weird - but it really did all work out) The birthday girl loved it and everything we did eat (sans glass) was excellent.
7284	3839	4.0	1	2012-10-21	It was almost good enough to justify the prices.
8759	3839	4.0	1	2012-10-18	My best friend recently got married and we had her rehearsal dinner here the night before the wedding. I would like to give this place 5 stars... The only real problem with it is the labyrinth-like layout! We were sat in the back of the restaurant in a larger room to accommodate our party, and it was difficult to get back there. I also feel a bit bad for the other patrons, as we had 2 young children and a couple of hours drinking wine and waiting for the groom's family to show up, and we had to wind our way through several people's dining rooms on our way to the bathroom several times. (Which, by the way, were adorable. The bathrooms are all unisex, but the signs on the outside and the crazy paintings inside make your trip to the bathroom more amusing than just simply necessary.) Now on to the good! First of all, our main waitress was absolutely fantastic. I think her name was Angela. She was extremely knowledgeable about wine -- which was great, as our friend Alex is a bit of a wine snob. :) She was also very personable and friendly but not overbearing. Service moved briskly when it finally got started, and they were kind enough to provide us with some bread to nibble on while we were waiting. My first course was the Wild Mushroom Soup with grilled Amish chicken and truffle chive creme fraiche. I'm not a big soup person. I usually only eat chicken noodle, and obviously this is a far cry from that. I picked this on a whim because it sounded fancy and I think I was delirious with hunger by this point and wanted more than a salad, which was the other choice on our prix fixe menu. This soup is AWESOME. It was just a tad rich for my taste, but otherwise it was creamy and warm and like velvet in your mouth. It's served in a large bowl that starts off with the chicken and creme fraiche in the bottom, and then your soup is poured over top right in front of you. My second course was Jumbo Crab Cake with mustard thyme beurre blanc. I could have used more of the sauce, but otherwise it was wonderful. Lots of real crab, very little filler. And, of course, the sauce was a perfect pairing. Desert was a tiny praline pie, a tiny slice of bread pudding and a tiny brownie in caramel sauce. Everyone basically picked their favorite and started stealing from and trading with their neighbors, which was fun and yummy. I liked the little praline pie and ended up giving my bread pudding away. So other than the odd setup of this place, I loved it. I have to admit, it was a little fancier than I thought and definitely impressed me more than I expected. Go White Dog!
14550	3839	4.0	1	2012-10-14	Excellent food, lamb bolgenese is AMAZING! Beat salad was also delectable.  The apple cider was just perfect and delicious.  Will definitely be back.  Service was slow to seat, despite reservations and the kitchen took 40 mins to get our entrees out.  That was annoying, but the food made up for it.
14551	3839	4.0	1	2012-10-08	Delicious brussell sprouts!
7221	3839	3.0	1	2012-10-04	The food is great but the portions can be quite small considering the price. I caution though to not get takeout, the time I did they basically just threw everything in a cardboard takeout box. It tasted great, but looked nasty.
14552	3839	5.0	1	2012-09-26	Always good!
14553	3839	3.0	1	2012-09-18	"White Dog is not a place for a gastronomically mind-blowing experience. It's a good place for a fancy-ish business lunch where you want to 1) appear like you're taking someone to a fancy restaurant, 2) spend someone else's money because the food is too pricey for its value, and 3) be in good company so you can focus more on talking to your guests than on the mediocre food. Don't get me wrong, I love the concept of using locally sourced ingredients and the quaint atmosphere. The service is also pretty decent. But when you're a restaurant, food preparation is kind of a big deal. The NY Strip ($32), ordered medium-rare, came out well-done. The cut was too thick, too dry, and chewy. You need an extremely sharp knife to pierce through the rubbery surface of this really tough, unmarinated slab of meat. The butter sauce had no flavor, and the (""crispy""?) onion straws on top were mostly soggy and greasy. Brunch here is not too outrageously priced. For $14, I got the Crab and Spinach Benedict, which was good by itself, but the side salad was bitter, chewy (in a tough, hard to fit inside your mouth kind of way), and tossed in a flavorless dressing, accompanied by cold and dry fingerling potatoes. I've been to other Philly restaurants with a similar concept, but with much better-executed food. Something that stands out at White Dog is that they don't seem to get any of the sauces right. The lack of effort or skill in the way they make the food makes me feel like they are exploiting the idea of supporting local farmers to sell over-priced food to a well-intentioned community. Also, the restrooms here make me feel glad that I'm on the petite side. They may not be as forgiving to less miniature people. Dining room space is the same. Even I had to carefully wiggle into my seat. Overall, the food here gives off an amateurish vibe, and the experience is just extremely OK."
14554	3839	2.0	1	2012-09-13	"Apparently putting down white tablecloths and bragging about how organic you are is an excuse to charge $13 for a mediocre ham sandwich.  The jalapeno jelly and ""tobacco onions"" were hardly in evidence, the cheese was not special, and the ham, while plentiful, was nothing to write home about either.   These middling fillings were enveloped by what was allegedly a ciabatta bun, but sort of had the pillowy texture of a challah roll.  What's more, the round pickle slices that had been speared to the top of the sandwich had gotten the top pieces of bread sufficiently wet that the bun started to lose structural integrity.  Avoiding that problem should have been the whole point of using a ciabatta bun, if ciabatta this was. The pleasant company and convenient location salvaged the experience, but they also mean that this place will probably survive much longer than it has a right to."
14555	3839	4.0	1	2012-09-12	The food was fresh and delicious. Service was a little slow, so do not go if you are in a hurry. The interior feels quaint and homey, like an old Philadelphia tavern.
14556	3839	4.0	1	2012-08-30	I stopped by for lunch with my family, while in town dropping off my daughter at PENN. The White Dog's reputation preceded it, and deservedly so.   The ambiance is warm and comfortable, the menu is short, but creative, and the food is excellent. Our server was very good.   My two cents - The tuna tartare was fantastic. This was an interesting dish with the chopped tuna and seaweed on a crisp chip with a sauce including curry and guacamole. The ham and smoked cheese sandwich was excellent. On toasted bread, with nice spicy pickles. The fries were crispy, not greasy. I tasted the Tofu Tangine as well. It was a fantastic, flavorful mix of stewed tofu, veggies, fruit and Cous Cous.   The beer and wine selection is very good. They even had an interesting type of beer from one of my favorite breweries - Dogfishhead.   Overall, this is a great spot, in an area with lots of average restaurants. To me, it's also a nice bonus to know that it's organic. I can't wait to come back for dinner.
14557	3839	5.0	1	2012-08-21	I saw White Dog Cafe on TV once about it sourcing locally & humanly raised meat and it pipped my interest in coming here so when I was in town, I definitely had to stop by!   I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The ambiance here is amazing. So relaxing and they had a piano guy playing. Started off with bucket of mussels which I thought was on the small size but it was great. Could do without the bacon though. It made the dish so much heavier than it should have been. For an entree, we had the lemon olive oil poached Arctic char which was simply AMAZING. Tender, had tons of flavor, and the English pea spaetzle completed this dish! We really wanted to try the truffle fries since almost every review here was raving about it but unfortunately you could only order the fries at the bar. We were planning to but we were just so stuffed from dinner. I know it's strange but I would definitely say visit the restroom at least once. At first I was confused for about a minute then broke out laughing for another. (You'll see why.) Loved it!
14558	3839	4.0	1	2012-08-20	Stopped by this deceptively large cafe for lunch with my mom and some friends. They had a tofu offering for me (I'm vegan), but surprisingly, the tofu was very well-prepared. It was clearly not just grudgingly thrown on the menu to appease the weirdos like me :) They service was great--very attentive. They were also flexible enough to effortlessly accommodate a special request from one of our party members. All in all, a very nice place to grab a meal.
14559	3839	5.0	1	2012-08-16	Delicious pumpkin bisque!
14560	3839	4.0	1	2012-08-09	Especially for brunch, this place delivers. They have exceptional food for a fairly reasonable price. Will keep coming back and definitely a place I would take out-of-town visitors to University City or Philadelphia in general.
10339	3839	5.0	1	2012-08-07	White Dog...will leave you howling in ecstasy...as long as you're up for a little adventure and try the (hushed voices...executivesouschef's...hushed voices) masterful creations. The Toy Box: Crispy, fat asparagus half tempura fried will leave your dining partners green with envy that they too didn't order this brilliant creation. The creamy white cheese - perhaps a soft Mozzarella? - and sliced mini tomatos (orange, red and yellow) make for an artfully delicious centerpiece. Colors! Flavors! And green drizzle! Pho Special: Even though I'm totally not a noodle fan, and generally abscond from the room whenever spaghetti or udon is mentioned, I'm a bacon lover and pork belly aficionado. There's nothing worse than too fatty belly, too soft flour noodles and too under flavored broth. This means that there's everything right with thick, juicy, white squares of tender belly, al dente soba noodles and bacon broth. So what if you can see the fat floating in the broth bowl...slup it up. Ravioli Special: Never before have I been served one ravioli and had it called a dish...even at the most pretentious tapas restaurants, this would be an abomination. Screw that. Eat one of the chicken and soft cheese filled raviolis settled atop a creamy tomato sauce brimming with tomato chunks, which add a brilliantly bright acidity  to he dish, and you'll never question ONE ravioli again. The Dandelion Salad: Lucky for your tush, you can get this every day. Mega props to anyone who can make dandelion not taste like bitter, acrid, weed killer spray. The long dandelion leaves are dressed in a summery sweet dressing, topped with crunchy sunflower seeds and adorned with edible flowers. You'll feel like a princess (or prince) in a poppy field eating this. And if your'e worried about all of the tempura fry, pork fat, bacon drippings, cream sauce I just told you about...don't. It's organic. This means it's got like 0 calories.
10934	3839	5.0	1	2012-08-07	"When the server starts to rattle off the specials, you probably do what I do at most restaurants - Pretend to listen intently but you're gonna order that thing that you decided on already anyways. You might say ""sounds great"" oh ""oooohhh"" in a soft voice(but loud enough for your date to hear you), but we all know these to be silly platitudes. This is not the case at White Dog Cafe. I had the opportunity to delve in to some extraordinary specials at a recent dinner there. I don't really remember exactly what they are called so we're gonna have to go by descriptions here- heirloom tomato toybox - Asparagus, delightfully tempura-ized on one half and left naked towards the leafy portion, forms a square fort around a delicious mozzarella/tomato salad that is both a delight in taste and presentation. The dressing is light and doesn't make me feel like I'm drinking trans fats with my vegetables. I took a photo that should be attached to this review. the thing with the udon noodles - Take two of the most delicious pork belly pieces in Philly, put them on top of buckweat noodles, drench that shit in bacon broth, and add some hot sauce. Oh yeah, I said bacon broth. This is the singular most impressive dish I've had in a Philadelphia restaurant since I first had Han Dynasty's Dan Dan noodles and if you are a follower of my reviews, that is an impressive accolade. the ravioli - some sort of meat-stuffed ravioli with a robust tomato sauce served atop magic vegetables. I took a photo of this one as well. This review is getting lengthy so I'll summarize the rest: Dandelion salad - great, unique. lobster mac n cheese - good, heavy. seitan dosa - good, unique. fried cauliflower- best fried cauliflower outside of Zahav. Semifreddo beats chocolate torta at dessert. On the action-movie-parallel-satisfaction-scale, this place is I Am the Devil but every character is now on rocket packs in every scene."
14561	3839	2.0	1	2012-08-05	Four of us ate here on a Monday night.   The service was terrible! It was not crowded. We ate outside and It took 1/2 hour to get drinks.   There was a series of errors and my husband went inside twice to get someone's attention.  My son, a vegetarian for almost ten years, ordered the mushroom sliders.  After taking a bite he realized they were the bison sliders!   After all that, they didn't even try to make good by taking that off the bill.  They did nothing!  And the waitress would not admit to making any mistakes at all, even after spilling the water on the table!  The food, though very good, is WAY OVERPRICED!   We will never go back.
14562	3839	3.0	1	2012-07-24	Came here with a friend to celebrate him finishing his first year at a job. He got this delicious sausage pasta dish while I got this chicken breast dish. The sausage dish had many layers of flavors and texture, being mildly spicy and savory and juicy, while the chicken dish was pretty much grilled chicken in one dimension. Pretty pricey, with mediocre to good food, and lovely ambiance and excellent service. Would probably not come here again unless a friend specifically wanted to try this place.
14563	3839	3.0	1	2012-07-23	I stopped at White Dog with a friend for drinks, cheese, and dessert. With all the framed dog portraits, low lighting, and dark comfy furniture, White Dog is as eccentric and welcoming as your grandmother's living room. This is a cozy University City spot in a beautiful location. White Dog is a little crowded; the furniture is packed closely together in the rear dining areas, making it tricky to squeeze into your seat. We ordered a cheese board with 5 selections and some white wine. One issue I have with White Dog is that they have several wheels of cheese out on display when you walk into the middle of the restaurant. The exude a strong scent that initially made me worry that the building was decaying or something. Once I realized it was the cheese, I felt better, but it was not a good smell. The cheeses were decent, mostly mild and creamy with figs, jelly, and almonds on the side. I was disappointed that the crostinis and walnut bread provided were cold. They could have at least heated the bread. The desserts that followed were a blueberry tart and a chocolate torte. The torte had a silky texture but I could have done without the haphazard Redi-Whip blob and a single (?!) meringue on the plate. The blueberry tart was cold which was exceptionally disappointing as it was served with ice cream. I liked the ambiance of White Dog Cafe and the service was wonderful. Our waitress was very attentive and polite. The food was nothing special though, I don't think I would return.

14565	3839	4.0	1	2012-07-16	I've been to White Dog twice for dinner and once for lunch. I had the fillet mignon for dinner. It was juicy, flavorful, and perfectly prepared. The mashed potatoes were really good too. For lunch, I had the Black 'N' Blue burger, which was good. They have a really good local beer selection here too - Dock Street, Troegs, Sly Fox, and Yards among others. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel they are a bit overpriced.
11697	3839	5.0	1	2012-07-14	Came here with a few friends for University Dining Days and it was absolutely delicious! I ordered the mushroom soup, steak, and blueberry crisp. I also opted for the wine/beer pairing, which was an extra $15 but totally worth it. Everything was seasoned perfectly and had really nice flavor. I assumed they would cut back for the prix fixe menu, but the portions were surprisingly large. I hear brunch is also pretty good here, so I will be sure to come back!
11765	3839	3.0	1	2012-07-09	Stopped here for a quick lunch. Honestly, it was good...but it's probably yet another one of those places to cross off the list and not come back to. On the other hand, I was surprised at how excellent our server was. She was attentive, friendly, and provided service I'd expect at a place like Morimoto or Davios, not at a bar. Black n Blue Burger: Overall, the burger was pretty good. It was greasy as all hell but cooked how I ordered it. There was no bacon overload (sad face) and the bread was a bit soggy. The thing that ruined it for me was the onion...the menu said grilled red onion, and I really don't think it was grilled unless they grilled a day's worth that morning and it had been sitting out all afternoon. Now before you call me an onion Nazi, I didn't care how it was cooked so much as how it tasted. It was not portioned right for the dish, overwhelmed all the other flavors, and just left me thinking meh. Conversely, the hand cut garlic fries were very good- crispy, just enough salt, and there was a decent portion. All in all, if this place couldn't wow me with a burger, I seriously doubt anything else would be that good.
6898	3839	3.0	1	2012-07-06	I went to White Dog Cafe last night with a couple of co-workers and a candidate for an open position where I work. One of my colleagues said it was underrated, so we figured to give it a shot. White Dog is New American, and it's price like an upscale restaurant. The scene is nice, and so is the service. The menu is somewhat small. I decided on the mushroom barely soup and Atlantic Char. The soup is pureed and tasted pretty good. Not the best I've had, and I actually prefer this type of soup not pureed so much. I really missed the taste of the barely. The Atlantic Char was tasty. There was something that was guacamole like under it that really added to the flavor. It was a good dish, but I cannot say it's holding it's own against some of the more fancy New American joints. One thing that White Dog has on some of the better restaurants is it's in a location with little competition. If you are in the University City area and prefer not to venture into Center City, this might be your best option. That said, it's far from the best, not worth the money, and certainly not underrated.
14566	3839	5.0	1	2012-07-04	"I'm pretty certain that this was the most expensive meal we've had, but it was so good! Everything was awesome! The meat platter was good, the beer selection is great, but what stood out were the spicy lamb bolognese and the lobster mac-and-cheese. They were so good that we both tasted them and actually exclaimed ""Goddamn"" as if on cue.  The waitress, Lisa, was really nice, knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive.  I really don't mind calling this one of our dinner standouts."
14567	3839	4.0	1	2012-06-24	Had a delicious brunch this morning, sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather.  I had the chocolate chip waffles, they were AMAZING with gooey banana and candied nuts.  My husband had a delicious omelet and potatoes.  And my friend had stuffed French toast that was incredible.  Coffee was good.  Service was good.  My only complaint was the bloody mary was very spicy.  I enjoyed them but they definitely would not be everyone's thing.
14568	3839	3.0	1	2012-06-17	This is like the grad student bar/bistro hangout on the block, the prices along would scare a normal undergrad away (if they were as poor as I was).  They have a really smallish but local microbrew based beer menu.  The food wasn't bad, but for the prices you are paying in the neighborhood it could be better.
14569	3839	4.0	1	2012-06-11	Good food and locally grown. A fun place to go for a nice dinner
14570	3839	4.0	1	2012-06-10	I'm glad White Dog is my 100th review -- I had a great brunch here on the weekend.  Their Crab & Spinach Benedict is scrumptious!  It was served with salad and home fries, so I'll write this review in sections. 1. The Benedict itself: Two perfectly poached eggs atop some crab and spinach on half a toasted bagel.  Topped with creamy hollandaise.  It may not sound super amazing (or maybe it does!), but all the flavours combine wonderfully for a really tasty breakfast.  The crab is great in there.  All of it tasted not only delicious but also GOOD and healthy.  White Dog says they use only the best, local, organic ingredients and I believe it!  The effect: a little indulgent but also comforting -- it made my body feel good. 2.  Watercress Salad is a delight!  Actually, this salad was the star of the show, overtaking the Benny.  Fresh watercress, lightly dressed, chopped red onion, capers, cherry tomatoes -- the salty savoury bits were refreshing with the slight bitterness of the springy watercress.  This watercress salad was sheer joy and I'm not even much of a green salad fan usually.  However, I would have wanted a bit more tomato.  And a bit more watercress.  More salad.  Please. 3.  Fingerling potato home fries were all right.  Not the best.  Nothing wrong with them, but next to the Benny & Salad, they didn't measure up.  I ate most of the potatoes with sriracha ketchup (which was asked for and served separately). 4.  Also tried my companion's Lancaster Omelette with goat cheese, spinach, applewood smoked bacon -- it tasted okay, but the egg seemed overcooked.  I didn't want another bite.  But, I'm not into omelettes or overcooked beaten eggs in general. Great service.  Friendly and helpful.  When asked, our server gave a detailed description of the Benedict, which definitely informed my decision -- the watercress salad isn't mentioned on the menu, and he told me about it.  I don't know if the Benny's always served with the watercress salad, so I'll have to ask when I'm back. Washrooms feel cramped and grungy -- more like a bar than a nice brunch place.  But who cares about tiny washrooms when there's crab and spinach benedict with watercress salad?
6909	3839	3.0	1	2012-06-05	Buy Fresh, Buy Local, Pay A Lot.   White Dog is a good restaurant, if the prices were more reasonable it would be a 4 star place.  The menu changes with the seasons and depending on what items they get from local farms.  It is a cozy little place and would be a good place to take a date.  The service is good and the food is equally good.  I really haven't been dissapointed in any aspect of the place when I've been here except for when I get the bill.   Perhaps it is my expectations when I go to the restaurant.  I simply don't view it as an upscale restaurant even though it's priced that way.  I mean the food is good so I expect to pay more than I would at New Deck or Mad Mex which are on the same block, but I never leave feeling like the price I paid matched the experience I got.
14571	3839	4.0	1	2012-05-25	I was just visiting Philly for a day and we happened to walk by this cafe near UPenn. If I went to school at UPenn, I would come here everyday for lunch. It's a great place to have brunch! The venue was very cute and the weather was perfect that day to sit outside in their patio seating. It's kind of a hole in the wall. We couldn't figure out where their front door was. Their food was delicious. We shared their rigatoni and their bacon burger. Their portions are very reasonable. We didn't finish either dish and had to take it to go. I was very full and satisfied. It was a great place to sit with a girlfriend and just chat over tasty food while enjoying the nice sunny weather.
14572	3839	4.0	1	2012-05-24	Definitely a top notch spot for a Sunday brunch.  For starters, the coffee was amazing.  I'm not sure what they do to it, but it needed very little, if any, cream and sugar.  I split a crab and spinach benedict, a stuffed french toast, and a side of bacon, as always, with the wife.  Perfectly cooked eggs and crab on an everything bagel.  Nothing to complain about there.  And the stuffed french toast was delicious and not too sweet.  The local maple syrup tasted odd.  No one in our party could be completely sure it was real and not an artificial.  Maybe that's just how maple syrup tastes in Philly. I also give them props for taking my luggage (we had to make a train afterwards) and putting them in a closet until we were done. I understand that they take pride in their ingredients, and you really can taste the organicness and the localness and the cage-freeness in the food.  Ha ha.  I noted that a salad contained both a cage-free egg and a free range chicken.  I don't know the terms, so I'm not sure which, but one of those chickens is/was living better than the other one, and now they're united.
14573	3839	4.0	1	2012-05-13	As consistent as they come, with fresh, seasonal offerings, great ales.  Wait time can be long at lunch, so be forewarned, but they deliver on the promise.
14574	3839	3.0	1	2012-05-09	Order the jerk chicken drumsticks.  Although you only get 4 for $8, their finely-crushed potato chip(?)-crust is like crack.  My boyfriend always gets a medium-rare burger.  The patty is cooked perfectly and the toppings are garden-fresh.  Although the chefs are usually on-point, I was disappointed by the arugula salad.  For $9, you get a small plate of arugula doused in lemon oil, 1/4 of a pear, and three thin slices of parmesan.  A sweet port gastrique is supposed to cut the tartness of the oil and the bitterness of the greens, but it just sticks to the plate.  I had to scrape it off with my fork, and then pull it off with my teeth.  I might not have a problem with this if I were at home in my jammies, but when I'm on a date, it's a bit embarrassing.  I like White Dog, but there are equally tasty and more affordable dining options for this broke grad student.
14575	3839	4.0	1	2012-05-07	White Dog Cafe is one of our go to places for lunch since it's about 3 blocks from where we work. We also have been there a handful of times for dinner. I had been a fan of White Dog when I lived in Philly before and was looking forward to returning. I had heard some things about it changing hands and that the quality had declined, but I'm happy to say that White Dog is as good as I remember. They focus on getting their produce from local family farms and their meat and fish from sustainable and humane sources. This quality results is quality dishes. Everything is fresh and delicious. The preparation can be lacking at times as we've had the occasional overcooked burger, but more often than not, things are just right. They have a small but usually interesting beer list. Oddly, I've never taken a close look at their wine list so cannot comment. The atmosphere is a little hit and miss depending on what room you are in. Some of the rooms are pretty tight and parts of the downstairs tends to be rather dark. I even had to use my phone to see the menu one time. They also have a really pleasant patio which has been a nice place to enjoy and after work drink. Service is always friendly and attentive. I know some people complain about it being pricey, but it's worth the extra cost when you are getting food made with such fresh and local ingredients.
14576	3839	5.0	1	2012-05-05	This is by far my favorite sit-down place to eat in University City. I went here tonight for drinks and asked the bartender for a special request, he certainly delivered. I have also been here for lunch and had a tremendous salad. I don't know what the complaining is about, I would say the staff here cares far more about your dining experience than any other restaurant i've been to in the area.
14577	3839	4.0	1	2012-05-01	I was there with a group. Most people liked their entrees, which however were a bit small. Great fish and chips. Love the local beer selection. No one liked the olive oil ice cream.
11997	3839	2.0	1	2012-04-24	I could understand how as a Penn student or as someone who doesn't get out of University City you could think that this is an excellent restaurant. It looks the perfect, charming, cozy bistro to take your parents/ visitors for a de rigueur brunch or dinner. There's the comfy bar, serving up beers and watery drinks with a laid-back delay. There's the locally-sourced menu, the casual pictures of dogs everywhere. And there's the food - safe, mediocre, overvalued. The bread basket with honey is delightful, as are the stuffed dates and the fingerling potatoes. Everything else usually tastes like you would expect it to, except every once in a while when it's very busy or when no one cares what gets served.
14578	3839	3.0	1	2012-04-23	Note that I usually give 3 stars to any brunch place I go to. I had the crab and spinach benedict bagel and was very happy with the dish. The server was prompt, noted all the specials, and my friend and I had a pleasant meal. I am glad that this restaurant is very responsible when it comes to its ingredients. The salad for the bagel was kind of bland (no dressing) but that comes down to personal taste.
14579	3839	4.0	1	2012-04-22	I've only had the pleasure of eating brunch here and I have to say it was pretty damn good. I've eaten the chocolate chip waffles, whole wheat pancakes and the lancaster omelette. All of these were pretty excellent, but I have to say that the lancaster omelette was reaaaaal heavy on the goat cheese which would be my only complaint. However, the waffles and the pancakes have really wonderful combinations of flavors that just make them perfect. My mouth waters every time I think about the lemon curd and blood orange syrup on those pancakes! Although this place is a little pricey, you can't beat unlimited $10 mimosas/bloody marys/greyhounds with brunch. I definitely get my moneys worth every time :)
10859	3839	4.0	1	2012-04-22	So close to being a perfect meal. I do not get out to University City much but this place has been on my must try list for a while. The layout of this place works very well with some outdoor seating, a large bar area and a more quiet back dining room where I was seated. I love getting mussels when I go out to eat and these were some of the best I've had in the city. The bacon/beer combo was executed perfectly and the mussels themselves were fresh, huge and plentiful. For an entree I went with the five spice tuna. It came out and if I were anymore than only one pint deep I would have asked, that's it? It was 4 bite sizes pieces spaced out on the plate, probably about 2.5oz total for $29! Meanwhile I have to stare across the table at a plentiful bowl of the lamb pasta. I almost thought I was on a hidden camera show for a minute. For what it's worth (apparently $29) it was cooked well but I would have enjoyed more than four bites. The side of brussel sprouts I ordered was heavenly, so creamy and crunchy. They had a solid list of draft beers and a wide variety of wines which went well with the variety of men options. But wow, that tuna still disappoints me a week later.
14580	3839	4.0	1	2012-04-22	"Had brunch there and was wowed by the creative offering of local, organic foods as well as the pleasant service.  The ""bread basket"" had a lovely selection of not too sweet (which is GREAT) muffins chocolate and pumpkin, coffecake and a perfect savory biscuit.  We devoured it along with the perfectly cooked omelet with a well balanced filling of goat cheese, spinach, sun dried tomato and bacon.   The waitress kept our coffee cups filled (the coffee was as good, not great).   I thought it charming and will return when back in Philadelphia."
14581	3839	1.0	1	2012-04-22	So, they had a special Filet Mignon for $35.  I ordered it medium rare.  When it was served it was just short of well done.  I sent it back.  When the second filet was served, someone who I guess was the manager (he did not identify himself, nor did he offer any apology) told me to slice into the middle of the filet and see if I liked it any better.  It seemed as though the never heard of a meat thermometer.  An internal temperature of about 130 degrees Fahrenheit would be about right.  I understand that mistakes happen.  I have eaten at truly classy restaurant where, if they were in error, a consideration would be offered, such as a free dessert.  This no class restaurant offered neither apology nor a consideration.
14582	3839	5.0	1	2012-04-21	One of the first dates I went on with this girl Jamie was here. Years later, my sister and I would visit a friend of ours who bartended there to watch Red Sox games. Jump ahead a few more years, and i find myself frequenting this establishment again. I don't know the staff as well as I used to, but Ethan is still behind the bar, more than happy to pour me beers and whiskey. The food is phenomenal, and they have always been ahead of the locally-sourced trend. The hot dogs are a particular favorite of mine, especially while watching the ball game.
10814	3839	4.0	1	2012-04-08	For weekend brunch, this place can't be beat. For dinner...well, yes, it can. But I digress. The best part of the brunch are the $10 bottomless mimosas/bloody marys/greyhounds/sangria (any combos of drinks). Fav brunch dishes: sausage and biscuits, whole wheat pancakes (light and fluffy, a welcome change from the very dense pancakes at other places) and spicy lamb ragu.
14583	3839	4.0	1	2012-04-08	The food was delicious ( i got the lamb bolognese) but the service was a bit slow
14584	3839	4.0	1	2012-04-01	I ate here twice (two days in a row, actually), once for lunch and once for dinner. It's a little pricey, but the food is totally worth it. I actually preferred the lunch menu. Somehow they made a simple bacon cheeseburger taste out of this world. I normally shudder at the thought of fish and chips, but after tasting my friend's from White Dog, I'm a fan of fish and chips. We also tried the grilled portabella, which was yummy. For dinner I had ahi tuna and my husband had filet, which he claims is the best tasting steak he's had in years. We will definitely go back if we're in the area.
14585	3839	4.0	1	2012-03-29	"White Dog does every meal well. As a Penn student I'm there fairly often and I always know I will be happy, if not always thrilled, with my meal. It's a great place to grab drinks or dinner with a small group of friends, and the tiny dining rooms make it convenient for conversation. Plus the hostesses and wait staff are always pleasant enough. White Dog tends to be a little pricey, but there are good deals to be had. They have Happy Hour drink specials, a reasonable bar menu, and an ""all you can drink"" brunch cocktail special on the weekends which is WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD. Poor White Dog definitely loses money on those drinks when my friends and I have brunch there. Overall a solid UCity and Penn staple which I will be sure to visit every time I am back on campus."
14236	3839	4.0	1	2012-03-28	Mm! Very nice New England bar atmosphere. The sunflower salad was good, and the porcini-brushed tofu was yummy over the squash risotto. Fish and chips was huge and the fries were well-seasoned. Banana ice cream and bread pudding was just big enough.
5069	3839	2.0	1	2012-03-20	I know you can be overwhelmed, and I know you can be underwhelmed, but can you ever just be whelmed? That quote from a subpar 1999 teen movie basically sums up how I feel about the White Dog Cafe.  It wasn't awful.  It wasn't great.  It just kind of was.  We went here for lunch on a weekday and it was relatively empty.  I ordered the Ithaca Apricot Wheat, but had to repeat my order to the waiter three times (and it wasn't even loud inside).  My friend was given the world's smallest cosmopolitan in what I could only assume was a thimble.  We had the trio of hummus for our appetizer (I think by now my Yelp profile establishes how much I love hummus).    It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've ever had.  We also ran out of vegetables, etc. to actually eat the hummus with, but we couldn't find our waiter to get more bread.  I ordered the veggie wrap without cheese.  Since it was $13, I expected it to be the best wrap of my life.  It was decent, but nothing special.  I don't think that a slice of cheese would have changed it that much.  My friend ordered the famous hamburger.  Again, it wasn't amazing and it lacked flavor.   I was so excited to come to the White Dog Cafe because I am a huge proponent of organic foods, local produce, and sustainable farms.  I sadly wasn't impressed with my lunch here and I felt that their lunch menu was overpriced.  Perhaps their dinner menu is where their commitment to fresh ingredients really shines.
14586	3839	3.0	1	2012-03-20	"It was okay. I was informed that the $14 dollar burger was one of the best in Philly...but really it was pretty meh. The meat was underseasoned, the cheese had no real taste and looked plastic, and the bun was mushy. It did arrive medium-rare, as requested though. Also tried a tofu ""hotdog""...It was really terrible. I didn't have anything else, but i'm hesitant to return. For a mere 50 cents more I would go to Village Whiskey and get a cheeseburger. Definitely worth the hefty price tag there."
14587	3839	5.0	1	2012-03-11	fabulous. we stop here whenever we can. it's awesome. Here's some notes from our meal last spring. A fabulous local and sustainable restaurant in Western Philly with a chalkboard that lists the farm/origin of each ingredient they use. I'm assuming their menu is seasonal  Just about everything we ate was spectacular. We sampled a bunch of appetizers. The tomato/cucumber gaspacho: (peppery and a little spicy) - you can can get it with or without crab meat. It's vegan without the crab. Proscutto and melon: red and yellow watermelon was fantastic, duck proscutto was pretty fatty, but pork was lean and more tasty. This was actually the least exciting appetizer. The bacon wrapped quail was the highlight. Served with arugula, I will see my husband smiling for days in memory of that dish. Lamb Ragu with Ravioli: our only entrée with spinach, also a little spicy and usually served with what I'm sure is an awesome ricotta... All wines are domestic and beers are local. They did have a vegan chocolate pie for dessert which was more like fudge in crust, not great, but the vegan raspberry coconut ice cream was delicious.
14588	3839	1.0	1	2012-03-09	"Freshman year I lived in the dorms across the street from White Dog. I spent an academic year lusting after the delicious smells wafting out of the tastefully decorated front door, while I settled for dining hall pizza. Well, I finally ate at White Dog last September with a couple of friends in celebration of the start of a new school year. As a poor college kid, I ordered a $14 medium rare burger that I couldn't quite afford. I had reasonably high expectations for that burger, because of the wafting smell thing and fourteen dollar price tag. Also I think the menu gave a lengthy description of the burger's origin, something about grassfed cagefree vegetarian organic amish cows. When our food arrived, my medium rare burger turned out to be well-done. And not in the good sense of the word. In the charred gray not a hint of pink to be found anywhere how could anyone desecrate a fine piece of beef like that sense of the word. I politely pointed out the burger's well-done-ness to our waiter, who apologized profusely and hustled off the kitchen to order another. I spent the next 20-30 minutes daydreaming about my burger watching my friends eat their food thinking that our waiter must have effed up and written down the wrong order because how could anyone work at a place like White Dog NOT know how to cook a medium rare burger? By the time my second burger arrived, my friends had finished eating. I was slightly annoyed that my bun wasn't toasted this time, because they took 20-30 minutes to remake a burger in a nearly empty restaurant and didn't have the decency to toast the bun. I was more than slightly annoyed when I cut into it and realized that this burger looked exactly like the first one. In fact, they had probably just spit on it a few times re-warmed it and slapped it on a cold bun. I didn't have time to try my luck a third time, so I just ate it. After hastily dropping of burger dos, our waiter made himself scarce until it was bill time. Didn't ask how my food was, didn't refill our water glasses, I mean the man was avoiding us! While we were waiting for our bill, a family at the table next to ours asked the waiter to explain to their kids what the difference was between a well-done, medium-well, medium, medium-rare, and rare burger. Before beginning his spiel he shot our table a glance to see if we were listening. We were. With rapt attention. I've never seen anyone get that red while saying the words ""a medium-rare burger should be pinky-red in the center."" When he picked up our plates, I left nothing but a sizable chunk of grey hamburger on mine. He still made no comment. When he came back to drop off the bill, I told him that my second burger was no rarer than my first, and that he should let the cook know how his medium rare burgers were turning out. He apologized again and ran off with our money. No offer for a free burger, no nuffin. We ended up giving him a pity tip because honestly his life must just be terrible if he had too much anxiety to take ownership of an overcooked burger. So in summary: over-hyped, over-priced, poorly executed food. Either vindictive or completely incompetent kitchen staff. Sheepish servers. I'd hit up random freshman for a guest swipe into Kings Court English House's dining hall before I go back there."
14589	3839	4.0	1	2012-03-08	Very nice for dinner and gave off an intimate feel in one of it's many separate backrooms. Not a big menu, but enough variety that it left a number of good options. I was considering giving 3-stars due to the slightly high prices. Stuck with 4-stars because they had a nice selection of beers and I enjoyed the meal.
14590	3839	3.0	1	2012-03-06	For a place that I really don't like all that much I've been here a lot of times. I think it's too expensive for how good it is. One positive about this place is that there are usually a few strange things on the menu that sound delicious so I can be assured that something new and exciting will be going into my mouth. (that's what she said) I keep going back because I like the atmosphere and because like a moth repeatedly ramming itself into a streetlight I confuse the White Dog cafe for the moon and use it to navigate through the streets of West Philly.
14591	3839	4.0	1	2012-03-04	"I found myself at this restaurant quite by accident, and ended up returning the next night as well. Farm-to-table sensibility, delicious and uncomplicated food, very good service, nice ""vibe"". I highly recommend this restaurant, especially the tuna tartar first course, which is as good as anything I've had anywhere. Some very good vegetarian options as well!"
14592	3839	5.0	1	2012-03-03	I've been here 3 times and have had stellar service every time!  I get treated like family when I go.  Ok...my brother is the sous chef there...but even when he's not working I get a warm genuine welcome. The food?  Fantastic!  Being vegan I have a tough time finding vegan friendly options, let alone something that's actually good!  I highly recommend the Vegan Buffalo Cheesesteak and the Seitan Chickpea Dosas.   Cute, cozy atmosphere.
14593	3839	5.0	1	2012-02-26	Synopsis:  Pricey, but good. I first went here after my Penn Preview Day (which was coincidentally so amazing that I decided to stay here), so I don't know if I viewed this through rose-tinted glasses, but it was an absolutely amazing dinner.  My father had a lovely craft beer which he enjoyed, and I had phenomenal fish and chips from the Pub Menu.  Just a note, the Pub Menu portions are substantial enough for a full meal in and of themselves.   The overall portions on the pub menu are quite good, but I did feel it was a bit pricey, but as a newly-minted Penn acceptee, I felt it was worth the cost, and it was a lovely way to end the day.  The food was all sustainably and locally grown and made, and my fish and chips were absolutely divine, truly a rarity in Philadelphia. The service was quite quick, professional, and effective, and we were able to have a fast meal without ever feeling for a second as though it was rushed.  Truly, since then I have returned countless times for this same degree of reliability which White Dog has, and I have recommended it to countless friends for the same reasons. Also, on a side note I saw the Dean of Admissions there at the bar as we were leaving, so you may very well see him or other notable Penn faculty/administrators there.
10065	3839	4.0	1	2012-02-26	I've been to White Dog for both brunch and dinner, both of which were fantastic! The brunch in particular was outstanding, which was due in large part to the drinks. I'm not a bloody mary fan at all, but I LOVED the one here. So good! The ingredients are fresh and local, which really comes through in the flavors. The menu changes by season, so be sure to go back regularly!
10895	3839	4.0	1	2012-02-23	Best place for a business lunch in West Philly. We always bring visiting faculty here. Food is local/sustainable with quite a few vegetarian/vegan offerings, so there's something for everyone. While nothing I've tried here is out-of-this-world, everything I've tried is pretty solid. Prices are on the higher side but reasonable, especially for lunch (that's what makes it good for a business lunch). Service is always excellent (servers are super polite and attentive). The place itself is classy in a cute and homey way, like eating at someone's rich great aunt's house. A rich great aunt with good taste in decor (you know, for an old person).
14594	3839	3.0	1	2012-02-20	Cute atmosphere for a date or with friends, except it's very tough to get reservations. I called for reservations for 2 on a Saturday night at 5:45 PM and the estimated wait time was 30 to 45 minutes. Either Philly people eat really early or this place is bumpin'. My date and I showed up around 6:30 and just sat at the bar, which was totally fine. Definitely better than waiting a very long time to get a table. Wasn't too hungry so we skipped the meat dishes and ordered the mushroom gnocchi and the lobster mac and cheese apps, as well as the beet salad. Loved the gnocchi dish since there were all types of yummy shrooms looming in the thick soup but wasn't so much a fan of the lobster mac and cheese. Not too much lobster in there and it was incredibly thick, moreso than my liking. If you're a Kraft kinda person this is super fancy and comes close to an overdose of cheese. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and delicately prepared. The pricepoint isn't terrible either. Cute, cozy place, not super romantic.
14595	3839	3.0	1	2012-02-20	3 stars is my averaged rating: for most food we got, easily a 4 star place, but for my personal dish and service, I'd give it two stars. I was disappointed because I want to love this place, with it's local/sustainable thing going, but there were some definite flaws. First off, our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable. Just SLOW. After I noticed the pace, I timed it at 20 minutes between when he cleared our dishes off and asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu. 20 minutes! It think our entrees sat for a while before being served to us as well because he forgot about us, but that's just a hunch. I got the rib-eye special, which was totally overcooked and kind of hard - definitely not juicy like i'd expect a fresh, local steak to be. It was served with some sort of fried scallion/onion which were hard and stale, really not good. The greens were whatever too. Overall a solid 2 star dish. However, everything else got rave reviews. I tried my friend's duck, which was very good. Our appetizers were great (apple cider pumpkin soup was my choice and I was happy). I didn't try the flounder but my friends enjoyed it. Our desserts (dark chocolate pot, bread pudding) were very solid as well. Overall, I think I would enjoy coming back here and I probably will. I like to think we caught our waiter on an off service night and that my dish was just a total miss. I expect better things when I return.
14596	3839	4.0	1	2012-02-16	An excellent place to take a visitor for a nice lunch in University City. Friendly service, nice decor, and good food. I recommend the Spicy Lamb Bolognese, and the burgers are good too.
14597	3839	4.0	1	2012-02-13	I wish I could indicate service as opposed to food and decor and so on.  great and large place although still very intimate.. in a nice brownstone setting.. with three floors and many different rooms.. all in wood and country like setting.  The menu was I would say one of the better brunch menus I have seen.  I was recommended to have the eggs benedict which were placed on top of a bagel, and of course I had to have a bagel being from NYC, my only complaint is there was way too much salad as a side to this dish.  The potatoes were excellent, just the way I like them. I don't like poached eggs but was able to enjoy these , no part overwhelmed another.  It blended well.. If the service was faster and there was less salad on my plate and maybe there was more wines on the list I would call it perfect experience.  alas
14598	3839	5.0	1	2012-02-10	What a delicious meal! I had a lamb special that was quite tasty and there is a good selection of drinks. Only downside is that it costs too much to go there every day!
10260	3839	4.0	1	2012-02-08	Finally tried White Dog and I definitely enjoyed my experience. On a late Saturday afternoon, after finally waking up from a night out in Olde City, I was craving some really good pancakes. Per several other Yelp reviews, I ordered the pumpkin pancakes and was not disappointed. They were delicious, I could really taste the pumpkin spice in each bite. They also came topped with a cranberry jelly of some sort which was also really good. My friend ordered the sausage and biscuits (and offered me a generous sample) which were kind of disappointing. The gravy was very bland and the biscuits were heavy and pretty flavorless themselves. I wouldn't waste my time ordering them. Our waitress was really nice, the bathrooms were an interesting surprise, and the drink menu had a lot to offer. I can't wait to go back.
7519	3839	4.0	1	2012-02-08	I came for brunch over the weekend and had a great meal.  Always nice to find a new brunch option in the city.  Food is really good, and fresh (and local).  I had the crab and spinach benedict which came with crispy potatoes and a simple salad that i really enjoyed though it was a bit overdressed for my liking.  My cousin had the sausage biscuits and gravy which I tasted a bite and really enjoyed.  I thought everything benefited an additional grind of pepper but that is a small thing. Mimosas were slightly small for $6 each.  Waitress was nice and definitely the opposite of overbearing but we were never without.   The place is huge and I look forward to more meals there. The drink menu had a nice selection and they had a ton of great draft beers as well.
14599	3839	4.0	1	2012-02-04	White Dog is generally the place we go for a nice, sit-down lunch, though we've been known to go for dinner as well. It's also one of the default choices on a bad weather day, as it's one of the closest options near work (though, can't make it a habit since it is rather expensive for lunch). I enjoy the food, and I support the concept (local/seasonal/sustainable), but sometimes I feel like there's something keeping it from being truly exceptional. Taking a quick look at the dinner menu, I'm drooling, so it must just be that I'm getting bored of the lunch menu. I love the chalkboard indicating the local farms where all the ingredients come from. The apple cider pumpkin bisque is a wonderful soup, and the last time I was there I had a tasty porcini-dusted tofu entrée with butternut squash risotto. The burger is pricey but delicious, and their fries are excellent. Lately they've been offering a BBQ pulled pork sandwich special that is also lovely. They also have a great local craft beer selection, which unfortunately I've had to school myself to ignore during the workday, but I owe it to myself to get a beer after work one of these days. They do have good service, but even in the middle of the day, there are some tables in this restaurant where it's so dark I need to get my phone out or use the candle to read my menu, which drives me crazy. Even still, there is something inherently comforting about this place, so much so that it's the first place I think of when I'm having a rough day and want to go somewhere to cheer me up.
10336	3839	4.0	1	2012-01-31	I love this place! For 2 reasons, 1. My husband proposed to me there and 2. because of the amazing Brunch they have. I had the poached pear and pecan french toast and it was amazing! We sat by the window, which I definitely recommend because I'm not one for sitting in the middle of the room when I'm trying to have a nice intimate meal with someone. The service was very good, the wait staff seem to be very knowledgable about the menu. The decor is rugged with cute dog pictures everywhere. The only negative is that the brunch is so popular that there is always a line if you don't make a reservation. I am also a big proponent of Farm to Table establishments and this one definitely has brunch down to a tee!
14600	3839	5.0	1	2012-01-29	The house where theossophy was founded...Very cool restaurant in an old home in historic university city with several dining rooms that's makes you feel like you are having dinner in the 1800s. The restaurant has just the right tad of creepiness. Most of the food and beer is local and organic. The spicy lamb bolognese is awesome! My fiancée got the artic char which she loved.
7427	3839	5.0	1	2012-01-29	I was here last night with a few friends of mine for dinner. I haven't been to this joint in awhile, but I think I'll come back a bit more often. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, I'm one of those eaters that takes a small bite of all the different dishes, it's all about variety right? The waitstaff was very polite and attentive without being overbearing. - Spicy lamb bolognese - delicious. A perfect amount of heat balanced with pasta that's perfectly al dente. - Chicken breast - surprisingly tender and moist, and the butternut squash puree it sat on was lovely. - I also had a bite of the osso bucco, one of the specials last night. The meat was delicious and the fried risotto ball it came with was absolutely heavenly. Good stuff.
14601	3839	4.0	1	2012-01-29	A wonderful gem offering great portions and quality food.  Reasonably priced.   I had a spicy lamb bolognese which was delicious.  A friend had a fried risotto dish which was even better.  Would highly recommend either of these dishes.
14602	3839	3.0	1	2012-01-23	I only had a chance to eat the bar menu but the food was good.  It wasn't the best bar food I've had but the beer selection was great and the staff was very attentive and friendly.
14603	3839	5.0	1	2012-01-08	I've been here many times for lunch and dinner (which I have usually found disappointing) but I finally dropped in for brunch; I am so grateful I did. The Pumpkin Pancakes were probably the best I've ever had.  I'm a huge proponent of pumpkin and pancakes so when they are combined well, I'm quite happy.  They were extremely moist, pumpkin-y, and the butter and syrup were delicious as well.  I cannot say enough about how tasty these were.  The drinks were also good.  I had the Blood Orange Chocolate Soda (the chocolate was kind of weird, but still interesting) and the More 'Smores, which definitely hit the spot .  They also have excellent beers on tap.   I'd highly recommend White Dog for brunch!
8057	3839	3.0	1	2012-01-06	My boss treated my department to lunch here before we broke for the holidays. I had a great time, the place is lovely inside (of course, I am smitten with the dog decor), and service was swell ... our server didn't bat an eye when my co-worker discussed pairing white wine with a burger. The funny part? I don't remember what I ordered for lunch. I liked it, but I guess it wasn't memorable. What I DID like was the pear crumble with black pepper ice cream. Just the tiniest bit pepperiness perfectly offset the sweetness of the pear. And I love a good crumble.
10855	3839	4.0	1	2012-01-05	Delicious! Gourmet local food, great flavor combinations. A bit pricey for the portions. Try the lamb penne!
14604	3839	4.0	1	2012-01-03	Gotta love White Dog. The food and service is reliably good and there are so many nooks of the restaurant, you always have a good amount of privacy.
14605	3839	4.0	1	2011-12-28	"I've had lunch here a couple times, and while it's not regularly affordable on a student budget, it is worth it sporadically for the right occasion. I'd describe the space as ""shabby chic,"" and kind of like someplace your aunt (the one who has nice clothes and plays high-stakes bingo) would take you. This past winter, I ordered the seasonal apple cider and the non-seasonal chopped salad which was absolutely divine. I think it's one of my favorite salads! It's the size of a kitchen sink, so I'd have them pack up half (with dressing on the side) before they bring it out... It sounds high-maintenance but I think that's the only way you can successfully enjoy salad leftovers. At least, that's what I had them do and it worked like a charm, except I'm pretty sure our server detested me after my request. I wasn't worried though, since my whims determine his salary. Also, if the hostess asks whether you have reservations when you walk in, they're just trying to play hard-to-get. I've learned this does NOT mean there's a wait; they always ask even if the place is completely empty, so be cool."
14606	3839	3.0	1	2011-12-24	This place is a bit confusing. I get a positive vibe from it, and the people try really hard to be agreeable, and serve agreeable food, but nothing really worked for me here. I ordered calamari and my friend got french toast, but my dish was just soggy, and not what I expected from the price of it. The french toast was great though, and I loved the sweetness. My waiter was really nice, but kind of ditzy and he forgot to bring us our coffee and other things we asked for, and we had to ask him twice for everything. However, I think it was just a bad day when I was there, and judging from other reviews, I would say it is a nice, kinda romantic place to be at (:
14607	3839	4.0	1	2011-12-21	The White Dog Cafe's food is not only fantastic it's locally sourced. I can't comment on the service because I ate it next door at the Saturn Hair Club but the food is impeccable. Try the Curried Cauliflower!
14608	3839	4.0	1	2011-12-16	You know the food will be good going to the institution for farm-freshness.  Cozy atmosphere in what feels like a big house.  Service was slow, but I guess they made up for it with friendliness.  Fresh bread didn't come out until we were done with our whole meal, but man, that is some good bread piping hot from the oven.
11832	3839	2.0	1	2011-11-15	Not sure what all the fuss is about.
14609	3839	4.0	1	2011-11-06	I went there for brunch with 2 of my friends. This place was very strangely set up. Like a grandmother's house. Colonial era hotel-ish looking place. I didn't mind it. The food was great. I got some crazy banana stuffed french toast, mussels with sausage, sausage,biscuits and gravy, eggs benedict and a bread basket. Banana stuffed french toast was SO delicious. I mean, it was ridiculously sweet and heavy. But I knew exactly what I was getting myself into. i enjoyed it. HUGE portioned meals. Mussels with crumbles sausage was also very very delicious. Possibly my favorite item from our brunch. We ended up getting another bread basket just so we could finish the broth. It was definitely salty, but still very good. Sausage, biscuits and gravy dish was just ok. The gravy was so heavy and very bland. i couldn't even take a second bite of that due to it's extremely thick texture. It certainly didn't taste bad, but just not as good as other dishes. Eggs benedict was pretty ok. Also very big portioned dish. I remember it being served with overly cooked/toasted english muffin. The hollandaise sauce pretty bland. It was fine, not necessarily a memorable dish. I would love to go back and order the mussels and try new dishes.
14610	3839	4.0	1	2011-11-03	White Dog Cafe is an upscale restaurant with prices to match. The server was extremely attentive and professional. The wild mushroom and apple cider pumpkin soups were excellent starters. We followed our first courses with another appetizer tuna tartare and double duck. The Duck was well flavored but diminutive. We also enjoyed the tuna, more ample and aesthetically pleasing to the eye.   Interesting restroom signs.  Choices include Pointers, Setters, Republicans, Democrats.  The rooms in the lower level are private and quiet enough for a conversation. Overall, this was a superior dinner experience with great ambiance.
14611	3839	4.0	1	2011-11-01	I ate here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend this week and it was perfect for that occasion.  Comfy and quiet inside, we got a nice, private table tucked away in the corner.   The server was excellent, kind, and attentive.  He filled my water as soon as it got to halfway (which was often, because I drink a lot of water).  And he took note of the fact that I am vegan after only mentioning it once (brought me olive oil with the *vegan* bread instead of butter without me asking).  He was also not intrusive or interrupting on what was clearly a nice date.   My meal, the seitan and dosas, was so effing delicious.  Nice to see a restaurant have a good vegan dish, not just a salad or some sad stir fry.  My boyfriend got a special that had pasta, lobster, and beef and enjoyed it.  We both also got specialty cocktails.  I got a Manhattan with figs which was one of the more delicious drinks I've tried.  My boyfriend got a hot toddy and loved it, the cinnamon sugar on the rim was a perfect touch.  Everything came out quickly too. My only complaints: I wish there was even one vegan appetizer.   And the only vegan side dish is a curry cauliflower.  Since I already got a dish with curry, I didn't want more. I wish there were more vegan options for dessert.  Only one. Overall, I loved this meal.  It was exactly what we wanted.  We will definitely return. UPDATE: While I loved dinner here and have had an equally delicious meal there, I was somewhat disappointed in brunch.  There was *nothing* vegan on the brunch menu.  However, they were accommodating and, with a little prodding, made a tofu scramble with veggies for me.  Don't know that I'll return for brunch, which their famous for.  Rather unfortunate.
14612	3839	2.0	1	2011-10-17	Service was a bit dull... and i was pissed that my table had a wobbly leg. Dumplings needed to be placed on a paper towel to remove excess oil, from the frying process. A slight sprinkle of salt would have also helped... I totally forgot what was my entree (and that's not a good thing). I should have just grabbed a hoagie from wawa, and saved a couple of dollars.
10077	3839	2.0	1	2011-10-09	Very very medium food as far as upscale restaurants are concerned.  When my meal alone comes to almost $50 without drinks I expect perfection and it just wasn't there.  The waitress was very well trained (serving the ladies first, clearing only after everyone was done eating, etc), but the food was average and the dining room was quite loud.  When we sat down one of us ended up with a lunch menu, the problem was quickly fixed, but we all noticed, as expected, that the prices were much more reasonable.  Next time we're doing lunch. The Spicy Lamb Bolognese wasn't spicy, rather the meat was dry and the sauce tasted like a typical vodka sauce.  It was very good and was a rather large portion for such an expensive restaurant; I was pleasantly surprised. The Duet of Duck was wonderfully prepared, but I'm sure they didn't have to give you so little.  I swear the entire plate could have been eaten in one bite if adequate motivation challenged were applied to the situation.  The homemade mustard was great, but next time put your effort into serving enough to share the dish with a loved one. Last, the fried green tomatoes were too hard for my liking, green doesn't necessarily mean not yet ripe, but I'm sure this was just someone else's take on the dish.  My only argument would be that the texture of the tomato distracted me from the over flavor.  We didn't finish the tomatoes. To end on a good note, the menu states 18% gratuity is added to parties of 5 or more, it wasn't added to our party of 7.  I'm positive the waitress benefited from this as we are all in the habit of tipping 20%.  Also, the waitress was willing to split the bill between seven people and four credit cards.  In summery, at the White Dog Cafe the service surpasses the cuisine.
14613	3839	5.0	1	2011-10-06	One of the best meals I have had for a long time. The chef really knows what he is doing with flavors, and some of the dishes are really complicated, with 6 different items and two types of sauces. All locally-sourced and organic if possible. I had the duck for starter and hanger steak for main meal, too stuffed for desert. This is a great place for a fine dinner in Philly.
11933	3839	4.0	1	2011-10-05	Beet Salad Lamb bolognese Rigatoni Lobster Mac N Cheese Everything was delish.. Wonder why they sat us in the fancy area where we were the only two patrons while there were dozens of others in the many diff levels of the restaurant. Service is great. Food is great.
14614	3839	4.0	1	2011-10-01	Food was delicious and atmosphere was very nice. Frankly, the most tender Fillet Mignon I've ever had in Philly.
14615	3839	4.0	1	2011-09-28	The food was really great! The Salmon was super light, buttery, flaky and the vegetables just perfectly cooked. Too bad they were running out of all the drinks we were ordering that night...But all in all we had a good experience!
14616	3839	5.0	1	2011-09-23	This place is a Philly institution and has only gotten better under new management. Love that they are still committed to organic, local food. Lamb Bolognaise is to DIE FOR. Though good, I think the brunch offerings could be a little more imaginative.
14617	3839	4.0	1	2011-09-13	"In the four years I was at Penn, White Dog always portrayed itself as classier than it actually was, especially towards the end of my senior year.  When I graduated in 2010, they were trying to cash in on the foodie craze with a new $26/entree menu, but I've thrown up downstairs too many times to take their ""fancy dining establishment"" persona too seriously.   In reality, White Dog is just a great place to meet for a drink or fifteen with your friends.  It's not terribly well known so it's never too crowded, they never carded very hard (or at all), and there are always open seats at the bar.  You don't have to shout to be heard, there's never any wait, and the pitchers are cheap and plentiful."
14618	3839	3.0	1	2011-08-27	Really more like 3.5 stars... I've been here twice for lunch and have been impressed with the food both times. I have been much less impressed with the prices. I know that sourcing local and organic ingredients tends to cost more, and I am more than willing to pay a premium for quality ingredients, but a vegetarian sandwich of mushrooms, hummus, greens, and multi-grain bread should not cost $12. I will say that the sandwich was perfectly toasted and tasted really, really good- in fact it is probably one of the best veggie sandwiches I've had in a restaurant, but it is just too pricey. The mushroom soup is also excellent- definitely more mushroom flavor than cream which I appreciated. The decor is cozy, but the service is surprisingly standard. I would consider putting this in my regular restaurant rotation if the prices weren't quite so steep.
14619	3839	4.0	1	2011-08-22	For being touted as one of the premier organic and sustainable restaurants on the east coast, White Dog certainly lives up to that bill. The quality of the ingredients in each dish are top-notch, usually local, and very fresh. Aside from the food, our waitress was not as good as we would have expected. She brought the wrong wine that a friend ordered, at times forgot about refilling water, and confused a dish. I typically do not care if the waiter or waitress struggles but it was a rainy, non-crowded Saturday night, I must say that there is no excuse for her to fault. So back to the food...I had a paprika spiced pork tenderloin with an accompanying risotto and the amazing lobster macaroni and cheese. I thought the entree was going to be better than the side dish but the lobster mac-n-cheese blew us away! So tasty. I would definitely recommend that to anyone who is dining there. It looks to be a signature dish and incorporated into all the seasons' menus. The appetizers of fried green tomatoes and the artisanal cheese plate were also very tasty and neither were entirely too saturated in salt or sugar. It was the right balance. Would I recommend White Dog? Certainly. I think it does a great job of setting out what it wants to do with its corresponding ingredients. Reservations aren't that frequent so if you want a table but worried that it may be filled, there is a decent shot you can bank on it having an available table.
14620	3839	5.0	1	2011-08-10	The food was amazing, the waitress was very pleasant and attentive the decor was really cool and I can't wait to go back!
14621	3839	3.0	1	2011-08-02	My wife had lunch here with her co-workers on a Friday, and was dying to take me there because the food was so good.  So, they next day we went there for dinner.  The ingredients are all organic and fresh, and both our meals were excellent.  The servings are small, so you will need to buy  two of three (appetizer, entree, desert) portions in order to not still feel hungry when you leave. I would have given them 4 stars (I gave 3 only b/c 2 is too harsh) but upon waiting for our check, we saw a rodent scurry down one of the walls in the dining area!  I know its not easy to totally eliminate all pests when your restaurant is in a row home, but for the price of the dishes, there should be an Orkin guy standing right next to the table!
14622	3839	4.0	1	2011-07-16	Absolutely magnificent food which is bolstered by the restaurant touting it's adherence to local and organic ingredients. A little bit on the pricey side, but well worth the money spent for not just the food, but the decor as well. My friends and I sat at a booth table with some very interesting decorations, and I was a little bit disappointed that the fire department made them put up exit signs in the dining room in which we were seated as it through off the ambiance. I would highly recommend the hangar steak as it is the best cut of beef I've had in a while.
14623	3839	2.0	1	2011-07-16	overpriced.  slow service.  meh food.  crappy cocktail menu (literally the worst I've seen). That about sums it up.  We were even there during University City restaurant week, so the meals were $30 each and included an app, main, and dessert sampler.  The appetizers were good, but it went downhill from there.  I wasn't paying attention to how much time passed between apps and the main courses, but it had to have been 30-40 minutes.  It also took forever to get our drinks refreshed.  Their specialty cocktail menu includes maybe four drinks - we tried two and they were both garbage.  And so overpriced ($12 cocktails are fine when they're delicious, but not when they suck).  The dessert sampler reminded me of pepperidge farm.  I won't be back for the food.  And as far as service goes, I almost NEVER tip less than 20%.  I left a 15% tip since the waitress was so slow and seemed like she couldn't be bothered.  What a disappointment.
7592	3839	4.0	1	2011-07-12	I went here for lunch, had excellent food, and everything is made from fresh and natural ingredients. Tasted so delicious and fresh! I'd go back.
14624	3839	2.0	1	2011-06-30	I went here once for a dinner date, and I was left unimpressed. After all the hype about it, even from my friends, it did not live up to my expectations. The food was okay, but the pasta special I ordered had way too much sauce on it and was still relatively bland. Since it is on the more expensive side, I never felt compelled to go back and try something else there.
14625	3839	2.0	1	2011-06-28	Mold! The hot dog we ordered had mold on the bun. If I'm paying $7.50 for a hotdog its gotta be really tasty, not the luke-warm plate of garbage we received. The pepperjack burger was awesome but everything was overpriced. The management handled the moldy hotdog situation in a very friendly and professional way although we felt sick for the rest of the day. Outside of all that the service wasn't great. We waited a really long time for the waitress to stop back and the hostess wasn't any help claiming our waitress was just busy, in a dismissive way.
14626	3839	2.0	1	2011-06-26	"POOR SERVICE, OK FOOD: save your money and go elsewhere. I was really looking forward to having brunch at the White Dog Cafe, having heard good things about it from friends.  The food was fine -- the cheese course, especially good.  However, service was terrible.  I mean, absolutely TERRIBLE.  From the moment we walked in, staff treated us with bored disdain.  The person at the host stand turned out to be a waiter, but if I am standing there and making eye contact and smiling at you and you can't seat me, then you should say, ""The hostess will be right back and she can seat you"" instead of looking right through me and, like the rest of the staff, acting bored. Started with the cheese plate which was excellent.  My brunch companion's bolognese was perfectly adequate -- it didn't blow either of us away, but no complaints.  Then the trouble started.  I had ordered the Sausage and Biscuits and when it came out, I discovered that the kitchen had forgotten to include the sausage.  It was just biscuits, potatoes and some gravy.  I finally got the attention of our waitress (who never checked in on us, I had to wave my arms to get her attention) and told her that my entree was missing the sausage.  No apologies, nothing, just a monotone ""I'll tell the kitchen.""   Another 5 minutes before they bring me the sausage and the rest of my entree is now luke warm at best, the gravy having congealed into an unappetizing mess.  The sausage patties they brought me?   Cold.  Not room temp, but COLD, as if it just came out of the refrigerator.  And the person who brought it to my table?  Again with the attitude ""Here's your sausage.""  No, sorry for leaving out the main part of your dish. This is the first time I have ever not given a tip for a meal.  But, if you give me zero service when the restaurant isn't even full, screw up my order, and fail to show any care at all for my dining experience, then the $50 we spent on brunch is more than enough.  Seems like the White Dog Cafe is all hype."
14627	3839	2.0	1	2011-06-24	After White Dog changed owners, I felt the food quality had stayed the same, and that the presentation had improved. But as time went by, I had more and more mediocre to negative experiences there. Now I only go if someone I know wants to go.
8739	3839	4.0	1	2011-06-22	If I had all the money in the world, and it was no big thang, I would give this 5 stars. Got a private room for a grad party of 12.5, and they took care of us very well. White Dog prides itself on trying to serve dishes made from local or sustainable produce and livestock. So, naturally everythign is fresh, delicious, amazing. I don't want to know how bad it is for me, because it's probably loaded with comfort ingredients, but not a person at my lunch had a single complaint. Since I visited, I have been craving their mushroom soup... and I don't like mushrooms. But it was so good, it's all I want. I also had a mimosa that hit the spot for a classy brunch, and the bacon and spinach salad. I entirely cleared my plates. Nothing was left. Amazingly awesome. Also, the cheese plates are a bit small, but not obscenely, and I loved it ALL. If it's not too late for UCity Restaurant Week, I might give in and get their prix fix.
14628	3839	4.0	1	2011-06-11	Great overall brunch place!! GO THERE! Be warned there will be a wait. Food:  Well, prepared Menu: Great;  Local, organic focus Atmosphere: Causal, very neighborhood feel Best Bloody Mary I had in the City!!!
11581	3839	4.0	1	2011-06-02	I had the opportunity to dine at White Dog with a good group of friends during my very own Senior Week. In other words, it took me four years to eat here. The Spicy Lamb Bolognese is great! I didn't expect to like it so much but it was perfectly seasoned and I loved the whipped basil ricotta. I think White Dog as a whole is a bit too expensive for the average college student, but it would be a nice place (on campus!) to take your parents for dinner if they were to visit.
14629	3839	1.0	1	2011-06-01	Food was barely fair, service was really poor.  Waitperson keep coming back to ask us what we ordered (1st drinks, then dinner, then who wanted coffee)  If they were new , they should have had more support. We went on a sunday night a couple of weeks ago and the place was maybe half full. Prices have gone up - that's OK, but shouldn't quality of meals and the service be in line with higher prices???
7256	3839	4.0	1	2011-05-26	Delicious and organic food. Good drinks and fun environment. Bar food is cheaper yummy.
14630	3839	4.0	1	2011-05-13	"We went to White Dog in February to celebrate my passing a big exam. The service was great - two glasses of champagne delivered to the table as a congratulations were a fantastic way to start. For our meal we had the bolognese and a pork special. Both were beautifully served, good portion sizes, and (most importantly) delicious! For dessert a friend of mine had called in to order a surprise for us and the kitchen created a beautiful platter with ""Congratulations!"" written in chocolate on the plate. A fantastic night well-complemented by a great meal and wonderful service!"
14631	3839	2.0	1	2011-05-08	I have been to White Dog more times than I can count. Generally speaking, the food is decent, but in recent months the prices have gone up while the quality has gone down. Dining there for dinner this week, my husband and I had some overpriced, incredibly mediocre seitan stew, so undercooked that the potatoes and carrots were still crunchy.  (A crunchy carrot can be okay, but a crunch potato is never acceptable!) Our appetizer of creamed spinach and the complimentary bread were awesome, but it's gotten too expensive for the add-ons to be the best part of the meal. Brunch there a few months ago was also a little worse than mediocre--a bland omelet with undercooked vegetables and home fries that weren't worth the calories. It also gave everyone in my party who ate it the runs. If you're looking for a new American experience in this area, go to the new MidAtlantic restaurant instead.
14632	3839	3.0	1	2011-05-07	Appetizers: yellowfin tuna tartare, mushroom soup, scallop. Main: Trout, Arctic Char
14633	3839	3.0	1	2011-05-04	Almost turned around as we walked in, when the hostess treated us very rude.  She just did not want to be there and you could feel that.  Maybe she was having a bad day, but come on that's your job, to be friendly and greet folks as they come in.  Glad we stayed, the beer selection was good, impressed with all the organic/natural menu choices.  The spring onion soup was perfect on a cold drizzly afternoon.  We were sitting close to the back of the front room by the kitchen and was able to chat with the chefs a bit, they were super nice and funny.  It looked like they enjoyed what they were doing which in my opinion is important when preparing food.  We were limited to the bar menu so I would be interested to try this place for dinner, just hope its a different hostess or her attitude has changed.
14634	3839	3.0	1	2011-04-16	The service was great, very attentive.  However there seemed to be a little disorganization the day I was there.  Servers had trouble figuring out where dishes were going. I got the spring onion soup and it was very yummy, best creamy onion soup I've had.  I also got a burger, and it was nicely prepared but extremely bland, even adding salt didn't save it.  I looked at a few of the other dishes coming out and they did look good and I was listening to positive comments from other customers so that's encouraging and I might come back.
14635	3839	2.0	1	2011-04-12	"Came here impromptu on a Saturday as a group of eight, which means you get charged 18% mandatory gratuity and no one has to really give a shit about how they treat you. They also refused to supplement our ""main dining room menu""  with the ""bar menu"" (read: cheaper, more student-friendly, and more variegated)  which was slightly infuriating because we would have ordered from both the regular menu AND the bar menu!!! As it was, the group ended up not even wanting to order that much food off the main menu because it was just so damn pricey, and there wasn't much variety to choose from.  We got crammed into this tiny and dimly lit (but kinda cute, I guess-- stars on the ceiling and a ""sun"" ceiling light) area with a group of 4 older patrons. Our waitress Kelly seemed nice enough, but kind of fawned over the group of old people much more than our group of 8. We ended up not getting even a bread basket until almost 30 minutes into the dinner, and that's only because I put on a sour face and asked 2 different servers for it THRICE. Meanwhile, the old people sharing our room kept staring at our empty dining table and wondered aloud if they should give us their extra bread basket (but never made a move). Overall, not a great dining experience and the food wasn't THAT good. The lobster mac n' cheese appetizer literally comes in a tiny asian-style rice bowl, and while the 'mac' part was actually quite good (I think they use shells shaped pasta?), the ONE lobster chunk i found in the bowl tasted kind of awful. Too bad for a fairly expensive appetizer. Also got the scallop appetizer, which also wasn't too great, owing to the weirdly sweet and pasty sauce it came in. Our group got several entrees, the only memorable one (and incidentally, the cheapest) was the lamb bolognese. None of the other fish/pork dishes ordered by my group were outstanding, and CERTAINLY not worth the $20+ price tags.  Save yourself money and time, and go for some less claustrophobic restaurant with better, more inspiring food."
14636	3839	3.0	1	2011-04-04	I've been here twice, once for lunch a while back (not really memorable other than the tomato bisque soup) and the other time for brunch.  Five of us decided to take our retiring professor out to lunch before he left the area and we settled on White Dog.  We met up around 1 without reservations and they were able to seat us quickly.  Turned out they had a brunch menu (who woulda thought!) which was a welcome surprise for me.  We ordered the bread basket for the table and I ordered an omelet and lemonade, both were quite good.  The bread basket on the other hand, never materialized.  We got our food and then I asked about the bread to make sure we werent going to be charged for it since they never brought it.  The waiter apologized, but was never really attentive throughout the meal... until it was time to collect payment, which he tried to do MANY times before we were ready (just let us chat!).  The experience was good because the prof is amazing, but the venue didn't add much.
14637	3839	3.0	1	2011-04-02	"Solid, hearty, earth friendly foods with vegetarian options.  The food was ok most of the time, and they do that whole ""free range/organic/vegetarian"" thing that is probably more important to others than to me.  It's overpriced when comparing this stuff to regular food, but that's expected.  The menu is always changing so I can't really recommend anything, but nothing I had ever tasted awful and more often than not, tasted pretty good.  The last thing I had here was a pork pulled sandwich.  The BBQ sauce was delicious.  Once in awhile, the serving size is tiny.  I get cranky when I end up ordering something that takes a couple bites to finish.  I've only gone here with co-workers and really wouldn't make the decision to eat here on my own, but can't complain about eating here.  The atmosphere is cozy, very light and airy in the summer.  A little like a farmhouse without any gross smells.  The service is awesome here.  Servers are very attentive and pleasant to talk to.  It's probably not a bad place to try if you're into sustainability.  I'm not sure what's actually sustainable and what's just a marketing scheme, so I'm not too keen about choosing my restaurant based on what the restaurant claims it's serving me.  The food is decent enough to try it."
14638	3839	4.0	1	2011-03-29	Very interesting menu and beers.  It's like being in grandmas house except everything is organic and expensive!  I got the free range chicken.  Really liked the tofu and rice dish.  I will get that next time I come...
14639	3839	2.0	1	2011-03-19	I went here for brunch and ordered their eggs benedict. The egg whites were severely undercooked and then covered up in sauce. The service was spotty as well. The layout of the restaurant is quite interesting because they have all of these different little rooms, but there is a lot of variation in the atmosphere of the rooms and we were seated in a very very dark room on a beautiful sunny day.
14640	3839	3.0	1	2011-03-14	I give White Dog 3.5 stars.  Very cute place, much nicer than I expected.  A few different rooms each with their own vibe and decor.  I went this weekend for brunch and got the bananas foster french toast and boyfriend got pancakes.  Pancakes were...fine. French toast was AWESOME, although SO sugray that I got a tum tum ache before the meal even ended. Prices were decent and their more savory selections looks and smelled great.   Out waitress was sub-par - it took until nearly the end of the meal to get 1 refill on coffee.  She seemed nervous and skittish, so maybe she was new.
14641	3839	4.0	1	2011-03-12	A group from work (8) met here for dinner.  The food was very good and service was attedntive and quick.  The waiter was a bit rigid in custom requests, but the menu made up for it.  Overall we were quite pleased.
14642	3839	4.0	1	2011-03-09	I've never been disappointed here.  Great farm fresh new american food in a relaxed cozy atmosphere, with mismatched furniture and lots of charm.
14643	3839	3.0	1	2011-03-05	Finally went to the White Dog Cafe. Came very highly recommended from a foodie friend. We needed a late nightspot for Saturday during parents weekend at PENN. First impression was a nice cozy feel of the place, and nice people that work there. Then came the menus. Raised eyebrow prices. Quality of the food was good to very good. Not excellent. Not memorable. What sticks in my memory was their sea scallop appetizer for $14.00. This includes two scallops. Overall a nice place to go near PENN, good - not great - service and food that does not quite match the prices. The prices match the hype. Good food but not great.
14644	3839	5.0	1	2011-03-02	My boyfriend and I shared a burger and fries and it was plenty enough for both of us.  The burger tasted fresh and juicy and was even better with the apple-smoked bacon strips.  The huge pile of fries were seasoned nicely and weren't overly salty. Overall, the experience was excellent - the service was good... the atmosphere really nice - we went around 5pm on a Friday so there were people sat around the bar having drinks and snacks and other parties coming in for dinner... I also really like the ethos of the restaurant and I'm happy to pay a little more to support local restaurants as charming as this one.
14645	3839	4.0	1	2011-03-01	I really liked their food here. i had a lunch special of soup and a mini burger and it a was perfect combination. i could tell they take freshness and flavor seriously. my friend's (regular) burger also looked good. its a quiet atmosphere, calming. i can't wait to come back for brunch!
11924	3839	5.0	1	2011-02-28	I have always recommended this place with friends who come into town and visit Philly.  It has a pretty cool menu selections and always have been impressed with it.  First time, I came with my parents and sister after my graduation and managed to get a table.  I had the thin shelled crabs which were pretty good.  The last time I came with friends and it was good as well but forgot what I got.  I remember for my birthday that my friend treated me with ice cream with a doggie biscuit cookie which was pretty cool.  Overall, this has always been a joy to visit for interesting selection as well as the Black Cat shop.  However, it closed a few years ago.  I also noticed the Bucks County Coffee Cafe closed which was also disappointing...  Well, at least, this one is still open and they opened another one closer to me in Wayne, PA.
14646	3839	3.0	1	2011-02-17	I love the atmosphere here but the food seems to have been inconsistent of late.  I enjoyed my meal -- but others were not satisfied and some of the meals seemed lost on the plate.  The night I was there there was a Penn basketball game and they blamed slow service on the crowd -- but I wasn't in a rush; so it wasn't so bad.  I have had very enjoyable meals here.  The rooms and the company can define your experience.
14647	3839	5.0	1	2011-02-16	I came back to White Dog for my 2-year anniversary with the boyfriend, and it was honestly the best dining experience I have had in Philadelphia since moving here in June 2010. We were seated at a cute little table near the window and were greeted with two glasses of champagne on the house and a congratulations for our anniversary!  It was such a kind gesture and the service was so happy and genuine--basically the perfect way to start out our meal. The bread that came out was warm, slightly crispy on the outside, and wonderfully soft on the inside. Salmon carpaccio: this was the special appetizer for the night, and it was well worth it.  The salmon was fresh and flavorful, and it was accented lightly with lemon juice.  The plate was garnished with a potato chip with craime fraiche on top and caviar.  A great, fresh starter that I highly recommend if it is available. Lamb bolognese: This dish is so hearty and delicious.  The pasta is cooked perfectly and the lamb and sauce are so flavorful with just the perfect kick to it.  I really cannot eat spicy food, and this was completely tolerable for me. Cheese grits: I have never had grits before, but I am obsessed with this stuff.  It is so creamy, rich, and cheesy with a little pepper kick, and this little bowl will really fill you up.  So if you have room, I suggest you try this!  Even if you don't, order it to go and heat it up the next day because it will still be delicious. Lobster mac and cheese: Just as delicious as I remember.  This time we got HUGE CHUNKS of lobster, which made it even better!  I will ALWAYS get the lobster mac and cheese at White Dog because it is so irresistible. Overall, a completely decadent, flavorful, filling, and wonderful meal.  We could barely finish half of it because everything we got was so creamy, but the leftovers were just as delicious the next day!  White Dog has now earned itself the status of my favorite restaurant in Philadelphia for a nice dinner, and I recommend it to all of my friends who want to take out significant others/friends for a delicious, classy meal.
14648	3839	3.0	1	2011-02-15	FOOD IS SUPERB!!! Service on the other hand was not so great. We were an inconvenience to her. For the amount of money, service is much to be desired.
14649	3839	3.0	1	2011-02-14	"White Dog fills an important void in UCity, in that it's one of very few restaurants that both a) has tablecloths, and b) runs less than $25 an entree on average.  There are two different seating areas (bar and restaurant) and two corresponding menus, but you can order off of either menu in either area, which is great  (I'll take the bar menu in the restaurant section, please).  There's also a lunch menu, a brunch menu, and a dessert menu.  Try not to get overwhelmed. Overall, the food is solid, but not something I would go out of my way for.  The last time I went, my friends ""medium rare"" burger ($14) was gray all the way through, and my smoked salmon sandwich ($13?) had a little too much pickled... something.  They make a mean cheese platter, though, and their hot cider is heaven in a cinnamon-rimmed glass. All in all it's not foodie heaven, but it's solid new-American that I'm always happy to eat. The service is reasonable, with one minor exception: the last time I visited (at lunchtime), our waiter never offered us the dessert menu.  I don't care if it's only noon, I want my apple cider donuts!"
14650	3839	5.0	1	2011-02-13	One of my favorite restaurants in the city, definitely my favorite in West Philly. (Farmicia is another fav & I recently discovered they were started from the same guy.. makes sense.) The menu changes periodically to maintain the freshness of the ingredients due to availability & season. All about sustainability, supporting local food & healthfulness- I have never had a bad dish here. Everything is spectacular. I would frequent it weekly if I could. The service is also always friendly & helpful when you're deciding between the many delectable menu options. Atmosphere is quaint, country & comfortable. Great for dates &/or brunch.
14651	3839	5.0	1	2011-02-12	Get a drink.  That is merely a statement.  Get a drink, why not? Honestly, an early afternoon bloody mary or dirty martini that is made well, makes any meal exceptional.  Couple that with an excellent meal and the experience of a lively collegiate/family/dating crowd and the experience is very good. The decor is very original.  It provides the feel of coming in from an English countryside foxhunt.  You just feel like having a pint or reading some Sherlock Holmes by the fire.  The wooded upper walls and ceiling in one room, the garden patio feel, of another, all the rooms feel like an English Inn or Manor. I haven't discussed food yet.  Bread plate with muffins and crusty raisin bread.  An omelete with fraiche, bacon, finger potatoes.  I can try to explain, or you can just trust me.  My dining partner had something seemingly simple, biscuits and gravy.  One bite of this simple meal made me rethink the use of the word 'simple'.  I could not identify every herb, not even close... but it was amazing. Waiter was very friendly and humorous.  When I asked him to box up the rest of my empty plate, he playfully pretended to punch my gut.  One of those 'had to be there' moments, but highly appropriate.  Excellent situational awareness from the guy. Others have said this is expensive, I thought fairly priced.
10307	3839	3.0	1	2011-02-12	"90% of the time you find me at White Dog, it means that my department is paying for me to eat lunch. It's a pretty solid place to have a business-type lunch on Penn's campus - say, if you've got a speaker or job candidate to feed. Especially if your department's picking up the tab. There's enough of a range of food that everyone can find something to eat, you can talk up the local food/Philadelphia history angle, and it's a pretty cute restaurant. It's not good enough that I'm that eager to give them my own money, though. I've always found the menu to be solid but uninspiring. Portions are adequate, prices are a bit high - especially considering we're in University City, not Center City. Service tends to be a bit slow and sometimes inattentive, although the place is always super-crowded at lunch so I get the impression they do what they can. The one thing that *will* bring me in to White Dog on my own is the hot cider they have in the winter. It's one of the only places in the area that has hot cider with liquor. My favorite has Tuaca in it, but there is one called something like the ""Apple Pie"" that comes with whipped cream and is DELICIOUS. If I'm looking to have a drink on a freezing day, it can be worth it to head here with some friends and sit in one of the booths in the room behind the hostess station and order some food from the bar menu. It's pricier than the other bars in the area, and the food honestly isn't any better, but I'll pay a premium every so often for some delicious cider. Mmm."
14652	3839	4.0	1	2011-01-27	In New York, we have Grey Dog. In Philadelphia, they have White Dog. Both of them are named as dogs, bringing out friendly qualities, but they are certainly different breeds. Unlike busy NY dog offering breakfast, delivery and catering, Philly dog managed to be civilized; Late morning start, maybe taking a walk, short lunch, then afternoon (tea) break, then dinner, and Brunch only on weekends. You know, this Philly dog has a life. They live in different houses, too. Philly dog owns a Victorian brownstone house. You pass through a narrow door, then walk through narrow corridors to find your own table. You have lots of options. Do you want a table at the sun-filled-greenhouse-feel room? Or rather dark cushion sofas? Or wooden bar with a high chair? Each choice is very British. It's easy to imagine you see Shylock Holmes with a pipe at the corner booth. Oh, when this dog wants to escape from Philadelphia city life, she (I decide this is SHE) goes to the peaceful farm house in Wayne. NY dog doesn't seem to be bothered to share one big room with everyone. You walk in the door, boom, one big shared space. No privacy or fun labyrinth. One way, straightforward, but communal. Does he (yes, this is HE) have a vacation house? Not yet. But he just purchased another city house in Chelsea. All rented. What do they eat? Quite different as you can see. Philly dog eats only local organically grown stuff. She's been doing that so many years now, it's not even mentioned during conversations with other dogs. 95% of ingredients comes from 50 miles within. This sophisticated dog doesn't like stuff loaded in trucks or being shipped from overseas. Fair traded coffee, humanely treated animals, of course. Look at this soup, white beans and kale. White dog prepared this because it's a kale season these days. Simply steamed, salted kale with not-so-salty ham was laid on the plate when served. Then this human waiter (hired by the dog) poured white bean soup in. Result? Crunchy kale bites mingling with soup. White beans didn't have much taste, mainly because of strong ham flavor, I suspect. Why I ordered this orange ginger tofu? I don't know. Any Chinese place will do a better job. Fried tofu had thick batter. It made a chef to cook easily, but landed on my tongue toughly. Mandarin, bell peppers, broccoli, nuts, peas, carrots, cabbages, rice were fresh, though. Just not distinctive enough. Then again, this dog is all about freshness. While I was cleaning out the dishes, people were coming in. Soon this room was filled with voices; Wikileaks this, Wikileaks that, 21st century marketing strategy, someone's tenure track... You can tell this is a hangout scene for University of Pennsylvania faculties. Of course, UPenn students made scenes, too. This is a place to treat your date after gruesome final exams. However, decision between having one crab cake dish or having 4 chinese take outs could be tough. I like Grey dog in NY, too. The point is that only being White or Grey could be boring. You need Grey dog for late night catch up with buddies, or when you crave salty stuffing salads. And when you need a space for reflection without anybody bothering you, or just want to pretend you're a faculty member at UPenn, you need White dog. Or maybe White and Grey dogs need to marry...? White has a nice house, money, sophistication, social responsibility supporting local farmers and Grey knows how to work diligently day and night. Beauty and the Beast? Yeah..They will make a good couple, I can see that.
14653	3839	5.0	1	2011-01-25	Best meal I've had in a long time Important note: While I am omnivore, my boyfriend is vegan. I placed a reservation via OpenTable, and noted that my boyfriend was vegan, and that it was his birthday.  I feel like these notes are hardly ever read, but they did - I was impressed! Drinks: Rosemary martini tasted like a margarita with rosemary.  My boyfriend, a rosemary fiend, loved it.  I also love rosemary, but apparently not in my drinks.  I got a blood orange chocolate soda - very good, but a little too sweet.  What else should I have expected though? First course: Salad of the evening - arugula, pomegranate seeds, toasted hazelnuts, parm cheese (on the side for me) with a sweet, delicious dressing.  Served with warm bread, brought out with butter & olive oil. Main entree: Boyfriend got the Seitan Stew, which he loved.  Said the spices were incredible, loved the pearl onions.  He was actually full afterwards, which never happens (vegan with a hollow leg usually means a second meal once we get home).  I had the Orange-Ginger Tofu and it was unbelievable.  I am a tofu snob (and by snob I mean I usually hate it unless it's perfectly firm and just the right amount of crispy, which it was).  The flavors were complex - sweet yet spicy, with the perfect amount of crisp vegetables.  Almost cleared my plate! Dessert: They brought out Dan the vegan ice cream of the day (bananas foster) with two cookies - with a candle in the ice cream, and Happy Birthday spelled across the bottom! Perfect!  I got the lemon meringue cheesecake, which topped off my food baby into a full food coma.  Incredible. The server was informed and accommodating, the food was much better than expected, and the restaurant was the right blend of cozy and upscale.  Perfect splurge for my boyfriend's birthday, and absolutely worth the journey to West Philly.
11928	3839	4.0	1	2011-01-24	ive only been to white dog for lunch and at the bar but it is a charming space and the food is consistent and reliably tasty. i loved their panini, and my friend got the burger which was also a solid choice. this place is pricier than other Penn-area joints but the quality is better as is presentation and service.
14654	3839	4.0	1	2011-01-20	I visited White Dog for the first time last weekend. I went for brunch with the lady. Cool story bro. For starters, we had one of the best waiters I've encountered in a long time. We spilled a drink on our table before even ordering but it didn't really matter. He was extremely helpful and genuinely nice (as in not fake). The single best thing about White Dog is their focus on sourcing local and sustainable food sources. Part of the reason I'm vegetarian is due to the problems with an industrialized food industry. I think all restaurants should feel obligated to support their local farms when possible. justsaying# The bloody marys we had were very fresh. The cheese platter we had as an appetizer was siiiiiick but could have used some additional crackers or something since the delicious cinnamon raisin bread was quickly 'used up'. I have the Kennet Square omelet and it was pretty bangin'. I wouldn't say the best I've ever had... but it was tasty. I would definitely like to get back to White Dog in the future. Nice, cozy spot with a vegetarian/vegan-friendly menu.
14655	3839	5.0	1	2011-01-13	Freaking amazing. If you're vegan, or even if you're not, get the Grilled Kennett Square Portobello & Spicy Cress Sandwich. It will change your life. Seriously.
14656	3839	4.0	1	2010-12-17	G Damn it's F'n GOOD!!!!   So were in Philly and some customers of ours suggest this place for dinner...   WOW.   Mac and Cheese with Chunks of Lobster...  I wanna rub it on my B*lls. So friggin good! Seared Ahi Tuna done insanely right! Baby Bok Choy sauteed' and Kim Chee. I could have eaten that All Night!  It's killer go!
14657	3839	1.0	1	2010-12-11	Do NOT go here for Brunch, at least not the Wayne, PA location.  The French toast was as dry as a newly packaged kitchen sponge and equally flavorless.  The Pumpkin pancakes were mediocre to poor also a bit dry and lacking ANY flavor, let alone pumpkin.  The waitress introduced the food mentioning organic this and locally farmed that.  I would have rather it come from a locally bought generic boxed pancake mix from the supermarket, it would have had WAY more flavor I'm sure.  The saving grace was the ambiance and service.  I had mentioned the dryness of the french toast casually and unbegrudgingly when the waitress asked how our food was.  At the end of the meal the manager sat down with us and apologized which was considerate but I still found my kitchen sponges charged on the check even though I left half on the plate and force-fed myself the other, hoping the next bite would be moist, but it never came.
7583	3839	5.0	1	2010-12-11	Headed here for brunch with my designated brunch buddy from school.  It was about 11 on a Saturday morning and we were seated immediately in a back room that was gorgeously decorated with gold mirrors and green velvet hangings.  A very nice ambiance.  We ordered the Sausage Biscuits and Bananas Foster French toast.  Heavenly!  Portions were generous and everything was so delicious.  Very attentive service.  With two brunch entrees and a coffee our total came out to $34.  So not the cheapest place but well worth it once in a while.  I had a great time here and I'll be back!
14658	3839	4.0	1	2010-11-27	It was pretty busy when I visited, but most of the noise was in the front at the bar. The back of the restaurant was very nice, like being in someone's very large, very nice house. Intimate, without being too tight. The food was very good, and I loved that it was mostly local and organic. Started with the artisan cheese plate, which as far as cheese plates go, was fairly good. Didn't blow me out of the water, but had a nice trio of cheeses. I had the spicy lamb bolognese as an entree, and my dining partner had the fillet mignon. The bolognese was excellent, but the fillet mignon was fabulous. The portions were generous too, we didn't even have room for dessert!
7913	3839	5.0	1	2010-11-19	I've been coming to the White Dog since I was a wee one. I completely disagree with the review by Ed M. and wonder why he insists on frequenting the restaurant if he clearly doesn't enjoy the food.  That's another story for another time, though... I enjoy the restaurant and the events that they hold. I've had two impressive meals in conjunction with community events - one a book reading with a sumptuous steak dinner; the other, a trolley car mural tour with continental breakfast and sit-down lunch. Sometimes, I will pop in and treat myself to lunch after a day of classes. The best meals I've had here have been shared with family and friends, though, and are often celebrations of something great that has just occurred. I greatly appreciate and admire how the White Dog works so diligently to provide fresh, local, seasonal, and organic ingredients on a regular basis. They even have their own bottled sparkling water! Some restaurants claim that their menus are local or organic, but it's such a small percentage of the items, that you might as well not bother mentioning it at all. I also find it admirable that WDC finds it important to connect with their customers and their community through regular events, educational opportunities, etc. I've never had a bad meal here and, for the most part, the staff provides a very enjoyable experience. I particularly like their soups and use of seasonal vegetables. I can always count on them to have vegan/vegetarian menu options which means I can come here with all of my friends. Penn students clogging the bar or not, cranky reviews by others or not, I will still consider this one of my favorite places in the city.
14659	3839	4.0	1	2010-11-17	Coming here last night was a great trip down memory lane, harkening back to the good old carefree days at Penn.  It being late, we were restricted to the grill,  which has lots of great options on the menu, so no problem. White Dog is an early mover in the locavore space - when I used to be a regular,  back in the late 90s, they held frequent events with local farmers, winemakers, and the like, and they've always made a point of purchasing locally, sustainably, and yada yada yada.  It seems somehow fitting that the charming, intimate and well-preserved rowhouse that White Dog calls home was once the residence of Madame Blavatsky, the controversial founder of the Theosophist movement. Our food was good to great - the pulled pork sandwich was particularly memorable.  Nice selection of wines by the glass.  Even as we were leaving at 11 pm on a Tuesday, lots of tables remained full and the room was animated - but not noisy. I was surprised to see comments about high prices - at about $30 each including tip generous portions and a glass and a half of wine per person, I thought it was a great deal.  White Dog is an excellent place to meet up with friends, enjoy some great sustainable grub, and good conversation.  I'll be stopping by whenever I'm back in Philly.
7688	3839	4.0	1	2010-11-09	I finally got to visit this spot. It's tucked away on the 3400 block of Sansom, which is a charming little block with great house facades that have been turned into businesses. I had never even been down this street and it's a nice stroll through the generally otherwise annoying University City area. White Dog has a neat atmosphere; it's a maze of different rooms set up as small dining rooms. The decorations are laid on pretty thick, and it's a great conversion of a house to restaurant without losing any of the charm. The service was swift and pleasant throughout the meal. I met here with my friend Quinn on a beautiful Saturday morning. Surprisingly, White Dog wasn't even close to full at 11am on a weekend. I've heard complaints about the prices here, but I found it in line with other brunch places. The exception is the drink menu. Bloody Marys and mimosas for $9 are just far too high. I stuck with coffee for the morning, and was happy with the fresh brew they kept pouring. Looking over the menu, there were several good options, but I landed with the steak and eggs. The dish had a good presentation, and overall I was satisfied with my choice. My only complaint was that the texture of the steak, in fact I question whether it truly was steak. It seems like a roast that was cut into strips before being topped with the other ingredients. Nonetheless, the dish was tasty and satisfying. Quinn ordered an omelet that came with mushrooms, onions, spinach, and smoked cheddar. She loved her option for brunch and the sample I had was good. She also opted for a side of extra crispy bacon, and it was cooked perfectly to her specification (although not to my taste). Bottom Line: There's not enough going on here to make me want to make the trip regularly, but I do believe that White Dog Cafe is serving up the best brunch in West Philly. I enjoyed my brunch.
7808	3839	3.0	1	2010-10-16	We came by at 10:15pm on a Friday night to find that the regular kitchen had closed, but we could still order off the bar and grill menu.  We started with the Crispy Pork Wontons - I was not a fan as I found the outside to be like fried wonton strips and equally tasteless and greasy.  However, the Mesquite Burger was great - tasty beef, deliciously smoked cheddar, and barbeque sauce that was flavorful, but not overwhelming. White Dog filters all of their own water and doesn't have offer any bottled water alternatives - very green!
7764	3839	3.0	1	2010-10-06	I concede that this place is pricey, but dining here on a bigger budget (not my own), I enjoyed my dinner.   First off, the restaurant bottles its own sparkling water, which I find pretty cool.  I think this is a free perk that really perked me up.  For my appetizer, I had a side of brussel sprouts with pancetta, which was fine, but pretty uninspired.  I prefer my sprouts bruised and battered (and a bit caramelized), not saucy and tender.  Others at the table had the beet trio, which looked great, and was universally enjoyed. But above all else, I loved my arctic char.  The skin was crispy and the whole plate with the mushrooms, swiss chard, and spaetzle felt earthy and extremely comforting.  It was perfection on a chilly autumn evening.   My only real qualm is with the sometimes confused service.  I think the waiters need to study the seating charts a bit more, and keep their frustration for their fellow waiters to themselves.  But for that beautiful arctic char, I would definitely go back.
14660	3839	3.0	1	2010-09-24	"Wanted to like it more, but New Deck is more interesting and a whole lot less bland...decent for happy hour and brunch. The menu is a bit pricey, even for the PENN crowd, so unless budget is no concern...I'd go elsewhere...like ""44"".  Just remember to bring a whole lot of friends...it makes it less stuffy, especially after the Irish pints get passed around.  :op"
14661	3839	1.0	1	2010-09-21	It's about location, not food. Stick to the bar menu.
14662	3839	2.0	1	2010-09-03	I had the lunch special. It was some type of chicken salad and cream of asparagus soup. Honestly, the chicken salad was the worst attempt at hiding yesterday's left overs. The soup was decent. Overall a lackluster experience not worth the high price.
10333	3839	2.0	1	2010-09-03	I've been here a few times since it's across the street from where I unfortunately spend nearly all my time.  I heard that it was started before the whole local produce/organic craze took over California.  Who knows!  There is a bar and the restaurant has a couple of dining areas.  It feels like a home and it's very cozy.  The food is good but it's quite pricey (entrees range from $12-16 for lunch, $19-36 for dinner).  I've never been here for dinner but I think this place stays pretty popular all day. The omelettes are tasty and quite sizeable.  The lunch options vary from time to time but they are very good.  I just don't know if I want to spend $20 for lunch/brunch and twice that or more for dinner!
14663	3839	2.0	1	2010-08-24	The White Dog, sadly, is right now like watching one of those Warner Brothers cartoons where a plane is diving towards the ground and Daffy Duck is trying to decide when to parachute out. There's always hope that, like in some cartoons, it will miraculously stop before it pancakes on the ground. I'll be sad if that doesn't happen, but nothing lasts forever. This is one of those stand-by places where even if it wasn't always great or stellar, it was never bad, and sometimes it actually was in fact great. Sure, the more-left-than-thou trappings could get a little old at times, especially in the newsletter the restaurant ownership put out. But it was reasonably heartfelt and the farm-to-table emphasis was in place here long, long before it became a general trend in restaurants. The sale of the White Dog is a complex story and best read about elsewhere. But I will say that even before the place was sold, there was a palpable, noticeable decline in the quality of the food along with a shift in the design and emphasis of the menu. In the last year, I've had a couple of notably weak meals here with the exception of brunch, which I think is still quite good. I used to take out-of-town visitors here regularly, and now I really wouldn't. It might be that the restaurant is still locally owned and buying stuff from local suppliers and all that, but that doesn't mean bupkis if what they put on the plate isn't good. And really, at the moment, it's not.
14664	3839	4.0	1	2010-08-07	Yum Yum Yum! My only regret about White Dog Cafe is that I didn't go there more often when I lived in Philadelphia.  It is a very cozy, romantic restaurant with good food and drinks!  I have had the stuffed flounder and the steak and they were both delicious.  It is by no means cheap but I think priced well for what you get.
14665	3839	4.0	1	2010-08-03	I went to White Dog for its University Dining Days. I can definitely say it was a meal worth the price! It was a three course dinner for $30. I don't think I would come here another time besides University Dining, my wallet will have a very large hole afterwards. The ambience of the restaurant is very homey. It makes you feel like you're somewhere far far away with lots of trees and nature, and not in the middle of University City. The food was quite good! I got Prince Edward Mussels, and it definitely was a larger portion than I originally anticipated. It was delicious! Then my Spicy Lamb Bolognese came. I wouldn't call it spicy. If you don't like lamb, don't get it. It had a lamb aftertaste to it. Since my mussels were so filling, along with all the bread I ate, I couldn't finish my lamb dish. Desert was great! I got a carrot cake. It's unlike any other carrot cake I've tasted. It's more of a cake sandwich than anything. I will post a picture to the pics section of it. It wasn't too sweet and overpowering. I'm not much a dessert person, but the carrot cake was definitely a perfect way of ending the meal. Service was great and our food came pretty quick. Overall, I would say it was money well spent!
14666	3839	5.0	1	2010-07-23	Every time I see a yelper review a place I've been to - even if it was years back - and I haven't reviewed it yet - I do.  In the case of White Dog Cafe, I have never been disappointed.  Their menu is so good - I wish i had multiple stomachs to eat more.  I usually get steak (which I did here) because I never cook it for myself at home.  The drinks and desserts are delicious as well.  I went mid week - and it was packed!  Though the wait was not long at all.  I generally don't trek out to West Philly for dinner - but was not disspointed by this trip.
7824	3839	4.0	1	2010-07-23	"To understand and appreciate The White Dog fully, I think a little bit of a history lesson is required for you Yelpers that are under 35 or aren't native to Philadelphia. Did you ever see the movie ""Invincible""?  It's set in and accurately depicts what is perhaps the darkest period of Philly's history, the 1970s, when Philly was a down-and-out former industrial power suffering along-with-but-possibly-more-than-most American cities through the social and economic ""malaise"" of the day. But right in the middle of those dark days, there were rays of light cast on our once-and-future fair city by the restaurateurs who were the vanguard of what would be called Philadelphia's ""Restaurant Renaissance"".  Those brave visionaries most notably included George Perrier (Le Bec Fin), Reed Apaghian (Astral Plane), and Judy Wicks, the owner to this day of the venerable White Dog Cafe. With an eclectic menu, quirky sense of self deprecating but unapologetically liberal humor, comfortable atmosphere, attentive professional service, and a dedication to locally grown food, The White Dog remains to this day the standard against which all similarly missioned establishments must be compared.  True, it is no longer unique or edgy, but that is more a testament to its success than evidence of any failure. Yes, it is quite expensive, so it is the kind of place where we go for dinner only occasionally, and then almost always for special events in a larger group.  But the portions remain quite ample, and I have certainly shelled out similar levels of cash for far less generously filled plates.  And the food never, ever disappoints. A great way to experience The White Dog (at least for two people) is to eat at the bar.  You may have to wait a while for hard-to-come-by seats, and you won't have access to the full menu, but the bar food menu is a treat in its own right. So do yourselves a favor and make sure you experience The White Dog at least once.  If you want to fully appreciate the phenomenal restaurant town Philly is today, an education re how we got here is a requirement, and nothing will accomplish that more than basking in Judy Wicks' eccentric and still-vibrant vision."
12037	3839	4.0	1	2010-07-22	My taste buds love this place... my wallet, not so much. I came here on a suggestion of a friend, looking for a tasty non-greasy meal before heading over to World Cafe for a show. I immediately had a positive bias towards this place just looking at it from the outside, its so cute. It was one of our 500 ridiculously hot days and I was eager to go inside for from AC relief. Sadly, it wasn't blasting as I had hoped, but we were sat under a fan, which was good enough for me. I kind of felt like I was sitting in some stranger's house, getting served a nicer-than-expected meal. I started with cucumber soup, which was a special that day. It was exactly what I didn't know I wanted: refreshing, tasty, and surprisingly filling. I made the mistake of ordering the artichoke bacon risotto, which although delicious, was entirely too heavy for a hot summer night. Whoops. The person I was with got some kind of fish (blanking on which kind) and it was amazing.. I wish i could remember what kind it was. Darn. I left here in an overall super pleasant mood because of the food I had received, with a slight price-induced shock thrown in.  I spent more here than I have on a meal thus far in the city (not including restaurant week). Ouch.
7843	3839	4.0	1	2010-06-13	"I came here several years ago with a large group. I had heard of the restaurant prior to coming here and was eager to dine here. I was impressed. I had a lamb dish that was expertly prepared. As I recall, the salad I had was delicious! This is a ""trendy"" type of place and I actually knew one of the waiters here. I like to try new places, so how frequently I would return I am not certain. I haven't yet. But I would welcome the chance to do so if provided the opportunity. Service was good. We had a dining room off the main area and we were cramped. It looked as though the rest of the restaurant was equally cozy."
14667	3839	4.0	1	2010-05-29	A lil overpriced because of dedication to only buying ingredients local. BUT the food is tasty. Menu changes but first time I went it was ribs, tatoes n collard greens. It was succulent fall-off the bone good. Other times it was good even if somewhat over priced.
14668	3839	2.0	1	2010-05-16	This place's rep is too big for its own britches. Eaten here a few times and have always found the beer to be overpriced and the food to be mediocre. That's not to say the food is bad, but certainly not worth the prices. So, if you're not paying, stop by. Otherwise, head elsewhere.
14669	3839	4.0	1	2010-05-12	The first time I went, I went with someone who is now my boyfriend. I had a good night here, and the bartender (his new friend) was really chill. We didn't really eat much but french fries and I had a Surf & Turf Ravioli which wasn't bad, but left me hungry still :( I want to try dessert next time :)
14670	3839	4.0	1	2010-05-03	"I saw a profile of the White Dog on the PBS show e-squared. As a fan of local growing, slow food, and organic ingredients, I insisted on going there on a trip to Philly from DC. The experience was good+, just shy of great. ACCESS There's street and garage parking nearby, but as this is in the heart of UPenn, Drexel, and Children's Hospital, be prepared to pay. LOCATION / DECOR The decor is wonderful, ranging from the full-bloom flower boxes (in May) to the hand-painted lintels on the roof held up by (faux) wrought-iron finnels. Large, cozy bar inside. Many separate seating areas and private rooms on two floors add an eclectic mood to the place (and it's obviously 1 or 2 old converted brownstones, so the funky architecture adds to the experience). A lot of warm, welcoming wood and glass. Outdoor seating is in the front on a gently-used alley and separated from sidewalk traffic by more faux wrought iron fencing. Comfortable and spacious. I could do without the wall-to-wall murals of crapping dogs that are in the bathroom and look like they were painted by a team of 2nd graders. SERVICE The service at the bar was great if a half-notch over the top (""Yes, sir! No, sir! That's a local beer, sir!""). The 'tender let me sample one of the Philly microbrews and sold me on the Yard's Brawler. He then kindly transferred our bill to our table after a seat became available...a small, but welcome convenience. The waitress was a little harried, but competent and nice. I asked to see a dinner menu (at lunch...just to see what else they offered), but never got it; not a big deal just one of those things. FOOD The food was good. My wife and I are vegetarian and knew WDC wasn't a veggie only place (responsible/organic/local, but not veggie) and so were disappointed when 1 out of 3 veggie lunch options were out. Food is on the slightly pricey side, with one of the other 3 options being a full entre plate of tofu and stir-fried veggies for $13...more than I want to pay for lunch, even for organic. Very nitpicky: My wife's veggie wrap (good) came with a side-salad of garden greens. It was passable, not inspired (3 grape tomatoes cut in half on top, no nuts/seeds, no cheese), but the dressing was a balsamic vinaigrette. Okay, I'm a snob, but you can make this stuff by the gallon and it's completely unremarkable. I would expect a restaurant like the WDC to offer a few clever spins on these old standby's: how about an atypical dressing, a cracker or bread at the start of the meal, a finisher of some kind? When you're good people know it, but when you're unique, people remember."
14671	3839	3.0	1	2010-03-29	Came to White Dog after a long hiatus to try out the new mgmt/chef. My friends and I brought a couple VIP guests for dinner, and we were crammed into a little pocket in one of the rooms. It was cozy, to be sure, but it was difficult for anyone to move... Besides the space issue, the food was decent. It was also pretty pricey. I got the tuna tartare for appetizer and trout for entree. The tuna tartare was pretty standard; I was expecting something great with it. Also, the plate for it was way too wide for the tiny tables we sat at, so I had to rearrange everything in front of me to fit the plate. Awkward. The trout was cooked well and the portion was perfect, but again nothing spectacular. Trout apparently tastes a lot like salmon. I've never tried trout before, but I like it! They also didn't have any hot cider, which I had been really excited for... but I have to say their Golden Retriever margaritas were great :)
8358	3839	3.0	1	2010-03-27	White Dog is an interesting concept.  They approach food a natural and sustainable way.  Which is always a great thing.  I'm all about eat local, grown local, etc.  Their food is GOOD. However, I wouldn't go seeking them out unless I was in the hood.  The bar / grill menu is great. The food is tasty, and relatively affordable.  I split the cheese plate, the fries (Which were REALLY GOOD) and humus with a friend.  It was all very tasty, though not entirely filling.  The beer selection is good.  I give it 3 star because it's nothing spectacular. It's good. It's a GREAT alternative to New Deck.  It's just not the first place I'd go for food and drink.
14672	3839	4.0	1	2010-03-14	We went to the White Dog for a late dinner, and the food was good. The meats were especially good. The deconstructed pot roast was excellent, and the flank steak special I had was really good too. I also started with a mushroom soup that was excellent. For desert, I highly recommend the Apple crisp. The service was good, and the local beer selection is excellent. The decor could definitely use a refresh, and while its not a ripoff, I would say its pricey. Overall, a good place to go if your near Penn.
14673	3839	4.0	1	2010-03-07	While visiting I went to the White Dog for dinner with a colleague. Upon entering the menu card is actually difficult to find and from the entrance the place looks like a regular bar. However, do enter. In the back there is a great dining room with good ambiance and plenty of room. Great example where looks can be deceiving. We had Ahi Tuna and  Deconstructed Pot Roast. Both dishes were prepared to order and very tasty. Really great food. Both flavor and presentation were great. I am certainly going to come back to try more of their food. Great place a little off the beaten track.
7907	3839	5.0	1	2010-03-05	Wow. I really wish I discovered this place sooner. Seriously, one of the places I'll miss the most about Philly. I came here for the first time with my friend for dinner and ordered Spicy Lamb Bolognese with a side of the fat fries. So good that after one visit I was destined to come back! Since then I have only came back for lunch and tried the Shellbark Hollow Farm Goat Cheese Salad. Why have I only come back once since then?! Both times I have came here, I felt like the waitstaff/bartenders were extremely courteous and friendly. (And they always have special events...like a PJ only party!) I like how they use quality local ingredients and whatever is in season. Hidden on Samson Street, this is a true gem! Must...come back...ASAP!
7908	3839	4.0	1	2010-03-05	i love white dog cafe and really enjoy bringing my friends here with me. it definitely is a great place to bring your parents, i have on many occasion came here with my parents and they have enjoyed it as much as i do. the restaurant is really cute as the decor in here is filled with pictures and statues of dogs - they really went all out with the theme and if you are a dog lover, like me, you will really like this. the food here is always very consistent and delicious. everything is organic and the menu changes frequently and seasonally so the ingredients are fresh. the early dinner menu is unique since it is all different sausages with an assortment of toppings. at first i was baffled by the concept but to my surprise it was really good. the only thing i didn't like was that the hostess/host likes to seat everyone really close to each other.
12030	3839	2.0	1	2010-03-03	Wow, I had just had dinner at White Dog but had to stop at Dunkin Donuts drive-thru on my way home!  WHY, you ask? Because I'm STILL FREAKIN'  HUNGRY!!!!!! My bf and I just spent $62 dollars on a dinner that could have easily been the equivalent of eating AIR!!!!! I'm not kidding, I feel like I never ATE!!! lol Have you ever gone to a restaurant, studied the menu for about 15 minutes to decide what to order and NOTHING GRABS YOU?? This was the case for us at White Dog. Finally, after feeling  a bit  pressured to order from the waitress, I ordered Tilapia w/ crabmeat and risotto which was their special tonight, and my bf ordered Mushroom soup and Flatbread w/ Roasted Pepper Hummus. (At least I think that's what it was.) He ordered that because nothing really appealed to him on the menu either. We got the Lobster mac and Cheese for an appeteizer, which was not bad.   I wasn't overly impressed with White Dog, and with a bill of $62.00 on a Wednesday night, I WANTED to be.The food wasn't terrible, but I have definitely had better food at a BETTER price. We won't be back here for dinner, but I won't rule out brunch, because we like the warmth of the place and the owner was very friendly.
14674	3839	5.0	1	2010-02-28	I really love the White Dog cafe.  It's a great place for a date, or a great place to take your parents.  The location is on the very cozy stretch of Sansom, which features other cute little stores and restaurants (used to be attached to the Black Cat, which I heard has recently closed, but that's another story.) I went to Drexel, had friends at Penn and still currently live in West Philly, so I have been here a number of times.  Dinner can be pricey, but they have a kind of bar and grill with lower-priced items.  A nice place to sit outside with a pitcher of beer and a burger on a warm summer night. The decor is very home-y and kind of country and of course dog-themed.  It sounds kind of cheesy, but it's very whimsical and kind of tongue-in-cheek at times (one set of bathrooms are labeled Pointers and Setters! I love it.) The food is traditional American, and free-range and organic.  From what I understand, the majority of the produce is locally grown. The food is very light and clean but very tasty.  I've had the wild mushroom soup a number of times and it is sooo good.  I'm not a vegetarian, but the last time I was there I got the orange-ginger tofu and it was great.  I'd recommend it to anyone- even non-vegetarians like me! Also, they have one of the best margaritas I've ever had- not overly sweet or syrupy, but just totally refreshing. I even bought my mom the White Dog Cafe Cookbook- she loves it! Haha.
10927	3839	4.0	1	2010-02-28	"our trip to the white dog started rather comically... we walked to the back ally.  For the life of me i was SURE it was the front!  I was told by my date that i was wrong.. but nope, i was certain! once we walked around to the front, it made sense, i said the words.. I WAS WRONG.  Note: this was a personal problem, and won't be a challenge for 99% of dinners.   Once we walked into the door, you feel at home, but more at home in a chester county restaurant than for downtown philly.  The friendly staff, greeted us and took us to our table. The setup is multi-room each with a different feel, but with the same themes.. dogs.... I started the meal with the apple salad.  It was unexpected, not apple on greens, it was some greens on apples... but very tasty, just enough dressing to not over do the apple, Gorgonzola cheese, or candied walnuts... We then where presented with Warm rolls, fresh butter...  I was shocked on how good the butter tasted.. it wasn't your normal ""whipped"" butter, you could taste it was ""the good stuff""...   My main course was the fresh sea trout. Amazing, the waiter did inform me that the type of trout they had was almost like salmon, and it was, wow so good.... The lentils and asparagus made it a very hearty meal. Desert was ok, the apple tart was good, not special... All in all for a sustainable (trout was line caught), small farm, the apples, butter.... it was expensive, but you pay for the fact that the food is treated well through-out all the phases.   It is worth every penny...."
5654	3839	5.0	1	2010-02-26	"GREAT place for lunch.  Excellent Sunday brunch spot.  Awesome food! All in all, White Dog Cafe is my kinda place for a laid back meal with friends.  I could see how this place would also be nice for business lunches/meetings.   Menus change quite frequently, but the chef wants to cater to your palette and would totally be willing to substitute one food item for another (ex.  I didn't want Jasmine Rice, so they gave me roasted potatoes instead :) One slight problem that people may have is that the seating is VERY close to neighboring tables....that's why a place like this shouldn't really be a ""date spot""....unless you're ok with people knowing your businaas :)"
10637	3839	2.0	1	2010-02-16	Good food, but over-priced.    $27 for a pork chop?  Perhaps the proprietors pay a premium for eggs borne by animals that have not been caged or for vegetables not treated w some special preservatives, but I'll gladly go elsewhere where the owners are less cognizant of cage-free and organic.
14675	3839	4.0	1	2010-02-14	Was there for Valentine's Day. The special menu had a good variety to choose from, and the entrees were excellent.
14676	3839	2.0	1	2010-02-10	"I am really unsure why this place is rated so highly. I was taken here for a dinner on a Monday night after a long day of interviews. The place was cute, with the historic homey feel, but the food was not worth the price! For 28 (but not on my dime, thankfully) I got the ""Seared Barnegat Light Jumbo Sea Scallops"" which consisted of 5 scallops barely larger than bay scallops on top of 2 greens and a smear of cauliflower puree. When I see ""sea scallops"" I think 2 inch diameter seared meaty goodness, instead I got less than 1 inch diameter barely cooked scallops with absolutely no wow factor or flavor. It was a good thing I ordered the ""artichoke bacon risotto"". However when I think of a good risotto, I think something a bit creamy but not very heavy - just slightly heavy. While it was tasty (if you got over the slightly undercooked artichokes), this risotto was DENSE, with cheese acting more like glue than being creamy. The positive comment I do have is the cheese platter was good, cheeses paired with fruit/nuts complemented well. For the price, there have got to be many better restaurants in Philadelphia."
14677	3839	1.0	1	2010-02-02	Food and atmosphere was great way back when. Now it's just a shell of what it once was. Sunrise, sunset. We have no bananas today.
14678	3839	5.0	1	2010-01-30	Holy mary mother of god! The best brunch I've had in Philly yet. A few weeks ago, the boy and I had a gift certificate for this place, so we decided to go to brunch, since it's the best meal of the day. I ordered the eggs benedict, which I had unfortunately never had before this. And my dude ordered the creme brulee french toast. Both meals were seriously amazing! The french toast tasted like christmas (my way of describing things as sugary, heart-warming, and full of joy). The eggs benedict, as my first experience with them? I nearly peed my pants, they were so good. Not to forget, this place also uses all fresh, locally grown ingredients, and you can really tell. Even with something as heavy as eggs benedict, I didn't feel shitty and gross afterwards (take note, bar brunch!), and that was all I could ask for. Additionally, I ordered the bloody mary, which tasted like actual crushed tomatoes.....it was kind of strange, but still yummy. The prices leave something to be desired, though. We had a $50 gift certificate between the two of us, and ended up having to put in an additional $15, due to some seriously overpriced bottles ($7 for golden monkey? I think NO!). Other than that,  I'd still say it's worth the splurge. Do it!
14679	3839	3.0	1	2010-01-26	meh...cool place, but its gone to its head
7970	3839	4.0	1	2010-01-20	I've been here a few times and love the warm, quaint feeling of this place. I feel like I'm coming back to the cabin after a day of skiing or something. It's definitely home-y. Now about the food. We started with hummus and the cheese plate - the cheddar and the little slices of toasted walnut bread were great. I knew that my main dish would be good after trying these appetizers. I ordered the steak salad - a five start lunch salad dish. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and the steak was cooked perfectly.
14680	3839	5.0	1	2009-12-20	I've been here a couple of times with my family for brunch/dinner and they've never disappointed. I think I like this place a lot because it reminds me of my hometown in Chester County where there are many similar places like this. It's very rustic and homey. The floorboards creak, the rooms are tiny & intimate, and the service is super friendly. Everythign is very clean and neat but still has that down home vibe. Food is deliscious and all fresh-farm grown and free range. Definitely a spot to go for nice Sunday brunch with family or a significant other. I'm seeing a lot of reviews after July 2009 that say this place has gone down hill. i haven't been to since around early-summer but I hope that isn't the case.
10101	3839	3.0	1	2009-12-05	Nothing special or remarkable.  This was my first visit under the new ownership.  A friend of mine and I were there for brunch.  The srever was friendly, but unattentive.  The bus boys, however, were terrific and would have made great waitstaff.   My friend's panini was just plain tasting.  My omlette was overcooked and the bacon inside dry and cold.  The fingerling potatoes on the side were undercooked and bland. I wouldn't make a point of going there, but if you are in University City on a Saturday at mid-day, they are about the only game in town sadly.
14681	3839	3.0	1	2009-12-03	Hoity Toity hippie food. According to local legend (and their website) White Dog has a continually changing menu of fresh, local organic ingredients.  That's cool, but how's it taste?  Turns out it is DELISH!  I ordered  tuna, which is admittedly pretty standard and difficult to mess up.  But the beauty of this place is in the presentation and care for how the food is served.  It's on top of perfectly prepared potatoes and some fresh greens -- I had to eat the whole thing!  I felt like they put so much more love and effort into what they served than most other restaurants. There are, however, a few problems with this place.  First of all, it's completely pretentious.  At least the back room where they sat us was -- with elder people in suits and dresses holding up wine glasses and laughing annoyingly at snooty jokes.  OK I may be exaggerating, but that's what it felt like.  Second, it's expensive!  dinner for two, one drink each = $100.  Third, very limited menu.  The usual for a nice place with fresh ingredients, one or two fish, one chicken, two vegetarian dishes that sound the same, one steak, one pork kinda menu. So all in all, I recommend eating there, just be prepared to spend some dough and shmooze with those who think they are elite members of the Upenn community.
14682	3839	5.0	1	2009-12-02	I ate at White Dog years ago with a friend and we did love it, but we never went back.  I recently went and am totally thrilled with the changes they made to the menu. The food and the service were absolutely flawless. Everything was fresh and simple seasonal dishes. I had a perfectly cooked piece of fish in a watercress white wine sauce as my entree. I am not usually a dessert person, but I got a little plate of fresh cinnamon donuts served with a trio of dips - a bourbon creme, a pumpkin butter, and a caramel. It was so good I devoured every bite.  Our server was attentive and very schooled on the menu. The place itself is really home-y and charming. It's nice to see them still sticking to their local, fair-trade roots, but really  stepping up the level of cuisine. I did find the prices a little high to really frequent the place, but I will be back for sure.
14683	3839	3.0	1	2009-11-24	I'm not a brunch person but this place definitely does the best brunch in Philly.  The problem is that service can be very spotty (read the reviews) at every other time.  I know there's been some recent personnel turnover so it's been tough to pin down the cause for the inconsistencies. Speaking for brunch alone, it's still a great spot in the PENN area.  Try the steak and eggs and of course, order a bloody mary.
8758	3839	1.0	1	2009-11-01	"I came back last Friday night to catch a late night meal after an extremely long day at work.  I ordered their burger and a Victory Pilsner. The bartender gave a fast pour of the Victory. I sat down at a small table to the side, since the bar was full. The Pilsner tasted funky, like someone hadn't cleaned out the lines in a while. Maybe I should make a list of all the bars who never clean their lines out. That might be a tall order around here though. My burger came out after a medium wait. The fries were crisp, some a little too crisp like they'd been sitting in the frier a little too long. The burger itself was cooked ok on the outside and the cheese was melted in. Unfortunately they undercooked it again. Medium does not mean medium rare. If I see much more than a little pink, that's NOT medium. I ended up eating the burger because I was starving. Bad decision. In the middle of the night I woke up and had some problems. I even felt bad the next day until after 6pm. If Clint Eastwood was shooting this, he would have called it  ""White Dog, Black Commode"". Second time, shame on me. Not going back."
7697	3839	1.0	1	2009-10-13	What happened to White Dog Cafe?  First time I was there for my friend Dan's 21st birthday and it was a great time.  My last time that I was there was last '09 Summer and it was terrible.  My girlfriend had ordered Meadow Run Spring Lamb ($29), and there was barely any meat on there plus she asked for well-done and it was cooked rare.   I ordered Spicy Lamb Bolognese ($19) and it was nothing spectacular for the price.  It was mostly rigatoni noodles and not much seasoning.  I know that I could cook better than this expensive, worthless dinner.  Extremely disappointed.  Never again.  Go next door to New Deck Tavern for cheaper specials.
8225	3839	4.0	1	2009-10-08	"It's about time that I get back into the flow of writing a few reviews. So I may as well dust myself off by getting ever closer to the goal of hitting 100 review updates that I made awhile ago (yelp.com/biz/rittenhouse…). So I may as well achieve it by reliving what might just be the most satisfying brunch item that I ever experienced. when my family came for a visit we decided to hit up White Dog, mostly by my influence because I respect them for their continued support towards the ""Buy Fresh Buy Local"" movement. It was a beautiful day and things were looking up when we were instantly seated in an outdoor table. It wasn't exactly the best of tables, and I'll get to that later. But as we read through the plethora of wonderful items on the menu, and sipped upon our coffees, it was the perfect moment of zen. And as I was reading through that menu I stumbled upon the most wonderful sounding thing ever. Crème Brulee Brioche French Toast! but since it came with a delectable assortment of Mexican Vanilla Bean Custard, Candied Marcona Almonds, Sun Dried Cherries, Organic Strawberries. I know your mouth is probably watering as you read such delicacies combined together, and I'm happy to assure you that it was perfect harmony bite after bite. ESPECIALLY when I added a side of breakfast sausage for that extra guilty pleasure (it tastes better with vanilla bean custard then you'd think!). So by now your probably wondering about the table pratfall that *sort of* infringed upon the moment of zen, and really it's all simple geometry. to sum it up, super sized rectangular plates DO NOT fit on small circular tables, ESPECIALLY when you have three plates to one table! reaching over to cut my sausage almost ended in comical fashion each and every time. yet since it was so damn fantastic you can probably imagine how often I made that valiant effort! it might be another kink that keeps White Dog from reaching that 5th star. But overall I still wouldn't change it for anything."
14684	3839	5.0	1	2009-10-04	"After my unimpressive experience earlier this summer, I emailed the former owner Judy Wickes about the experience. (I was unaware the restaurant changed ownership in January). Both the former owner and the new manager promptly and confidently replied that it must have been an exceptional ""off night"" and this was not the standard experience of White Dog Cafe. The new manager graciously offered to have us visit again to make up for the last experience. We returned for an amazing dinner last Thursday. In short, my confidence is fully restored that White Dog Cafe is one of the expectational restaurants in Philadelphia. Every detail, every ingredient, every person at the Cafe was just perfect. Two special notes of this last visit: First, we skipped out usual bottle of wine for a seasonal local micro-brew. The waiter suggested his favorite and this turned out to be an excellent call. (Note to self: when greeted by an expereinced/involved wait person, solicit and rely on their recommendations more often). Second, while enjoying our dinner we overheard a party of 8 at the next table raving about the deserts. They had ordered one of just about every desert on the menu and passed them around the table for all to share. Their praises just did not end. When it came time, we had to try a couple of deserts ourselves despite our vow to cut out sweets on our current fitness drive. The bread pudding, cheesecake and a coffee drink called ""Lassie Come Home"" capped off a terrific meal with a final round of dazzling impressions. We plan to return soon for cocktails and a light meal midweek at the bar because we've never done that and the bar scene at the front of the Cafe looks like fun. It seems like the type of crowd where it would be easy to strike up a conversation. We will find out soon."
10932	3839	4.0	1	2009-09-28	Food is spectacular! Love the attentive service and cozy vibe this place offers. SECRET: The bar is just as cozy and draws an electic mix from the academic and neighborhood crowd. A lot of people were there solo, but made friends quickly and it's easy to join an interesting conversation. This should be helpful as the rest of the bars on that block, LT, New Wave and Mad Mex can be packed!! Next time that happens, please give White Dog a try!
14685	3839	4.0	1	2009-08-31	"For 10 o'clock on a Sunday morning, I was surprised (and somewhat pleased) at the lack of people dining at White Dog.  We were given our choice of indoor or outdoor seating and were shown to a table in the somewhat tight gated-in patio area. I have never had gazpacho before, but I figured that a restaurant that uses fresh and local ingredients would be a great place to try it.  On the menu, under Chilled Green Meadow Farm Tomato Gazpacho it says, ""Micro Cress, Blue Moon Breakfast Rashish &amp; Summer Melon.""  When I asked the waiter what ""rashish"" is, he was all, ""huh?"" and when I pointed to it on the menu, he said, ""Oh, it's like a salsa with melon and radishes that we put in the bottom of the bowl before we pour the gazpacho in... it's really good!""  He was right, it WAS really good, but I wish he had just said, ""Oh, that is a typo.  It's supposed to say 'radish.'"" My dining companion ordered the Seven Stars Yogurt Parfait.  I stayed away for it due to a freak cherry allergy, but she really enjoyed it.  Although the waiter suggested that it ""definitely is a starter size, not big enough for breakfast,"" I think that it would make a great sized breakfast for someone who likes to start her day on the lighter side. Luckily, my friend and I are NOT that kind of girl.  We each ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict, which was served on half of an everything bagel with a side of  homefries and a small portion of greens with capers and red onion.  I had every intention of eating only half of the half bagel, one of the poached eggs, dipping my fork sparingly in the hollandaise and skipping the potatoes. I'm sure it wouldn't take someone who knows me THAT well to predict that I would actually do nothing of the sort.  The moment I broke into one of those perfectly poached eggs and saw the sunshine yolk spill onto the plate, I knew it was all over.  I threw caution to the wind and dumped the sauce over the whole plate, including the potatoes, and downed the entire serving.  Except the salad.  That was a little salty. Next time, I'm totally getting the Crème Brulee Brioche French Toast.  And I'm going to eat every bite."
12064	3839	2.0	1	2009-08-22	Cool atmosphere, but the food was mediocre.
10940	3839	5.0	1	2009-08-22	Possibly my favorite restaurant of all time. Sustainability and organic goodness at its best. True Philly pioneers
14686	3839	4.0	1	2009-08-12	I ordered the harvest bread basket and it had a variety of baked goods. The coffee cake was the best followed by the chocolate chip muffin, then the poppy seed muffin, and then the cheddar chive biscuit. The pastries were delicious and if I ever visit again I would just order the coffee cake and muffins! Their panini was very yummy but also very filling. The mussels didn't have much taste but the omelet was light and fluffy just the way it should be!
14687	3839	3.0	1	2009-07-08	You know, about 1.5 years ago, I would have hands-down given White Dog a solid 5/5 stars. White Dog used to be my favorite campus bar; a place to get away from the usual scene of Smokey Joe's and the Blarney Stone. The cafe had solid, cheap food, and $2 microbrew pints after 10pm... a deal, in my opinion, that could not be beat. Then, the management changed or something, and everything went to hell. Their best menu items were taken off the menu, and replaced with overpriced dishes that students only ordered when their parents were in town. The service plummeted, as the servers and bartenders became really unfriendly and, honestly, a little incompetent. I feel like whereas before White Dog used to cater to the students of Penn, the new management turned their backs on them. With the expansions happening around campus and new places popping up all the time, nowadays it's easy to overlook this establishment.
14688	3839	4.0	1	2009-07-03	Ate at the White Dog Cafe on Sansom Street in Philadelphia back in April, where they specialize in local foods (delicious.) and taking it slow. But maybe that was just our waiter taking the whole slow food movement far too literally. We could have done better with a *little* more attention from the waitstaff. Regardless: All good. And highly recommended. p.s. The structure itself is also a delight: the restaurant spans two old homes and the tables are set in alcoves and cosy corners to lend intimacy without being small.
14689	3839	5.0	1	2009-06-27	While the service was average, the food is amazing. For my entree, I ordered the spicy lamb bolognese. It was seasoned perfectly. The spices on the meat really stood out. The pasta was cooked perfectly. Now for the truly unique, on top was a whipped basil ricotta mixture that when mixed with the pasta and meat sauce was PERFECTION. Then when I thought it couldn't get any better than that I bit into a piece of fresh, juicy spinach. Glorious. May I also say, good size portion and good temperature. I hate when food is not a good temperature. My boyfriend had their burger with fries and a side of mac and cheese. Their mac and cheese is made with truffle oil and very yummy crumblies. But what truely sets it apart is the mixure of chives and roasted veggies they put on top of it all. The buger and fries were also perfectly made. Now normally I wouldn't get dessert but we had too seeing that this place serves banana bread pudding. (We never pass up bread pudding). Boy, were we glad we ordered it! It came with a custard that was just the right texture and sweetness. There were also fresh strawberries and bananas. A perfect meal.
14690	3839	4.0	1	2009-06-02	I have to post about how much better White Dog has gotten!  I had the first meal EVER there yesterday that I enjoyed.  For the first time, the food and the service were both excellent.  I had the spicy lamb bolognese, and I really enjoyed it -- the ricotta on top was cold, and they need to offer grated cheese with pasta (DUH!), but on the whole it was a first-rate dish -- tasted of fresh, local, homemade ingredients exactly the way a meal at White Dog should.  Better yet, they got the orders right and didn't need 3 hours to serve a simple lunch.  I've always been Mr. Negative about White Dog, but now I feel like the change in ownership may have successfully shaken it up.
14691	3839	2.0	1	2009-05-12	I want to love it, but I just can't.  The bartender is just lousy and miserable.  The pub food is ok and the main restaurant has gone down hill.  Buy the cookbook and make the original dishes yourself.....
14692	3839	3.0	1	2009-05-05	I would say the White Dog Cafe was a 3.5 star experience.  The food was tasty, and I appreciated how all the meat used was organic and that a lot of the ingredients come from Lancaster.  However, the Cobb salad entree I ordered was small and had very little greens in it; I had thought a salad would have mostly green leafy vegetables, but it was mainly all the other ingredients (cheese, avocado, etc) and a little too much of the dressing.  The coconut creme brulee was yummy, but I thought overall the price was a little too high for what was ordered (A panini, Cobb salad, and dessert came out to more than 30 dollars).  Atmosphere is rustic and beautiful, however.  Cute dog theme, too.  But I won't be coming back regularly just because of the price.
14693	3839	3.0	1	2009-05-02	I hate it when bad service ruins good food. Got here around 2pm for Sunday brunch. Was seated in a side room, away from the main dining area in the back. The place was about half empty, so there was no good reason why it took over 30 minutes for us to get our drinks (bloody marys and lemonades...not exactly rocket science). We had to ask twice for the drinks to come out. The food took another 15 minutes or so. The food was the saving grace. Big portions, great selection, everything was well cooked and tasted great. Special mention to the salad dressing, which most people at my table thought was amazing. Now for the best part. Our server charged us only for the food (minus one dish), not the drinks. Strangely there was a random $3.50 sausage charge and an 18% gratuity added (we were only a party of 5). Not sure if this was all done on purpose to reconcile the long wait for the drinks, or if it was trainee day at the restaurant. Brad's rating (out of 5): Food: 5 Price: 3 Decor: 3 (creepy dog paintings) Service: 2 Wild card: Top 5 brunch places in philly, too bad it's not in Center City.
14694	3839	3.0	1	2009-04-22	"3.5 stars.  I would say it's an American/New American style restaurant.  They have a bar menu and a regular dinner menu.  The dishes were tasty and somewhat creative.  The nice thing is that if you sit outside, you can bring your well-behaved dogs.  The beer list is pretty nice and I liked the names of the cocktails.  Oh, and the bathrooms - they don't indicate the ""W"" or ""M"" but rather ""Pointers"" and ""Setters""... cute.  I figured it out by looking at which illustrated dog on the door had the eyelashes. Lots of college students around.  It's right on UPenn campus, so make a reservation if you can.  It was packed early when we went, and even with a reservation, we had a 15 minute wait."
14695	3839	4.0	1	2009-04-12	It's been a few years since I've been to the White Dog, so I don't know if there's been any major changes since I was there.   Went there with a large group of friends unannounced on a Friday night.  Although they were busy, they swiftly turned the restaurant upside down to accomodate us.  Our menu varied and we all enjoyed what we got.  I had a great salad.  We all had drinks and they were reasonably priced.  The ambiance of the place is very cool, I totally dug the interior.   The White Dog has a very cool vibe. Good luck finding a place to park.  You're best off parking in the garage a few blocks away and hoofing it.
14696	3839	3.0	1	2009-04-09	Under new management, not nearly as good, quite a disappointment...
14697	3839	4.0	1	2009-03-16	Good food made from local ingrediants.  The dining room was beautiful, with quirky decorations.  We had brunch, which was great and reasonably priced (around $10).   Portion size varied:  the salmon benedict was huge and could have fed 2 people, while my French toast was on the small side.  It might be good to check with the waiter about that before you order. All in all, a great brunch place.  Best of all, there was no line Saturday morning!
14698	3839	4.0	1	2009-03-12	"My wife and I went to White Dog Cafe last night for dinner before a business mixer.  Some people commented about the menu differences between the website and restaurant.  It appears that dining menu changes quite often, but the bar menu doesn't.  They will give you a bar menu if you ask, but the wait staff doesn't like it (less gratuity). The food is good and there are some constant themes in what they serve.  They are a fan of their special organic greens.  It appeared to be a mix of fresh chives, parsley, and roasted peppers.  This found its way into our tomato bisque, on top of our mac & cheese, and on top of the salmon.  My wife really liked it and put on the fresh diner rolls as well (you are served about 1.5 per person). For beverages we had hot mulled cider.  Really good and the only organic non-alcoholic beverage.  Another party was disappointed that they the only other choices were water and coke products.  ""No Ginger Beer, and this place calls themselves organic?"" On the plus side, if you are vegetarian and the current special has meat they will provide a vegetarian version for you and most other on-menu choices as well.  Pasta and tofu seem to be the primary substitutes. All-in-all a pleasant experience, but maybe a bit overpriced for what you are getting."
10252	3839	3.0	1	2009-03-02	My bf and I have been together for awhile, and we finally decided that our parents should finally meet one another - a feat that was not easy to accomplish. After much consideration, and his parent's suggestions, we ended up going to the White Dog Cafe for lunch together. It was a really nice spot for our occasion: small and nice with a homey feel, a laid back vibe that was perfect for easy conversation. We were seated downstairs, which was quieter than the upstairs area that includes a bar, however we did have a view of the back alley where supplies were coming in for the kitchen. Our waiter was nice and attentive, quickly placing and bringing our order and checking up on us occasionally. The food was really good - nice cafe style soups, salads, sandwiches and entree type dishes as well. And since there's a bar, they offer alcohol in the cafe so my parents got to enjoy a cocktail with their meal. Everything was really good, we tried a butternut squash soup, spinach and goat cheese salad, grilled chicken salad, omelet and an asian beef noodle stew. The menu we saw was shorter than what's listed on their website, but I have no idea why. But its a pleasant place to have a good meal and only spend a moderate amount of money.
14699	3839	4.0	1	2009-02-23	Fancy food in a farmhouse!  For some reason I had it in my head that White Dog only had pub-type fare, but that's not the case.  And the whole place is so cozy and relaxing, I just love it. We only had to wait 15 minutes for a table for 3 at 7pm on a Saturday, since there are three levels and lots of space.  We were tucked into a booth in the corner of the lower level - the comfy bench seating along the wall made me happy.  Despite the coziness and number of people in the place, the noise level was low - I was probably the loudest person in the room, oops. As everyone else had said, the food is really good and fresh.  I started with a Dock Street Rye IPA which I really enjoyed, and went with the sesame-encrusted tofu for my meal.  I'm not a vegetarian and don't normally order tofu, but it sounded intriguing.  The tofu was soft and light (not chewy and tough), crusted in a crispy sesame shell.  The flavoring on the asian-style vegetables was quite tasty too.  And the portion was just right, leaving me full but not stuffed. I don't venture into University City often, but I'd love to come back here for a meal or a beer!
14700	3839	5.0	1	2009-02-19	I know that White Dog is notorious for serving local grown food but I was shocked at the freshness of the burger I had here a few weeks ago. I am not kidding you, this was probably the freshest and best burger I've ever had- carmalized onions (and I don't even like onions, but left them on), and perfectly melted cheese all combusted in my mouth for an amazing flavor explosion. The fries and Kensinger were icing on the cake. The bartender said that he thought the beef came from somewhere local, probably Lancaster, and now I am left wondering why fresh food like this isn't more accessible to people...? I have also been here for lunch and it was very kid friendly (menu, crayons, coloring paper).
12118	3839	3.0	1	2009-02-15	"I've always passed by this place but finally went in last night (Valentine's day). The husband and I weren't looking to do anything special; we just had to eat. And since we were in the area, White Dog it was! After a short wait, we were seated in a downstairs room with other couples. A little too cozy for my taste, but (almost) everyone was considerate and kept their voices really low...except for the tanning-bed-disaster Barbie in the corner. Apparently she kept telling her date/boyfriend that she wanted certain status symbols...so much that when they finally left, everyone around the room started chuckling and one of them even said, ""Whew, I feel like I can finally breathe again!"" Anyway, the food was good but not jump-out-of-your-pants stellar. We started off with the Hawaiian ahi tuna tartare, which had too much wasabi avocado and not enough tuna. I think I like Continental's version better. For entrees, my husband opted for the addition on the menu of meatloaf with yukon gold mashed potatoes (YUM, I LOVE yukon gold mashed potatoes!), while I had the crab crusted tilapia with fingerling tomatoes. He loved the mashed potatoes but the meatloaf didn't meet his golden standard. I, on the other hand, wasn't really sure how I felt about my dish. It was good, yes, but it took me a while to figure out. In fact, I'm still kind of indifferent about it. No dessert for us because we were very full, but given the chance, I would have gotten that yummy red velvet cupcake with cream cheese icing our neighbors had!"

The bar and dining rooms are beautiful, and I love the politicized sense of humor the entire place has. The first time I came here I ordered the soup of the day and it was unbelievably good: brown fat and sweet potato with creme fraiche. I'm sorry to say that I have yet to eat anything that good at White Dog again, particularly from their soup menu. The greek plate and stuffed pita were actually pretty terrible. But the coffee is good, piano bar and happy hour is fun, and they probably have the healthiest bar wings in the city. Overall, the vibe is what makes this place, so I would suggest just grabbing a beer and something to nibble on and not taking it too seriously as a restaurant, and you'll be happy.
14702	3839	3.0	1	2009-01-21	"I kind of loathe the White Dog.  I come here now and then, but with misgivings.  Here's the problem:  the White Dog is the best place to have a nice dinner and drinks in West Philadelphia, as other reviewers will corroborate.  This means that the White Dog gets to charge as much as they want for their food and drink--there's simply no competition. The tap list is generally excellent, and pints tend to be $5 apiece.  We had drinks in the piano bar recently, which is a really comfortable, dimly lit space, and we had a great time.  This is one place we come when there's a special occasion and we can't think of anywhere else to go. The food is where the White Dog really gouges you.  Tofu and vegetables for $13?  And that's just the lunch menu.  In general, the food has been pretty good, if overpriced, and if we or someone we know is feeling a little fancy we'll come here.  They took the ""Chihuahua"" egg dish off the brunch menu, although it was excellent.  But it's always with a tinge of regret that I eat here.  Local and organic are honorable commitments.  Totally screwing your customers with your pricing because they have no place else to go is another thing.  But I guess that's the free market.  As long as there's no real competition in University City/West Philly, we'll be back."
14703	3839	4.0	1	2009-01-16	White Dog is one of those places that you could return to a million and one times, and never get tired.  As mentioned in other reviews, the food is fresh, local, and organic.  The dishes are well composed, and you can almost taste the care that goes into crafting them.  The formal dining rooms can feel stuffy, but the bar food is cheap and easy.  Plus, the beer they brew ( beeradvocate.com/beer/pr… ) tastes nothing like dog pee!
10108	3839	4.0	1	2009-01-15	I've only ever been to the White Dog for lunch, so I'm only going to rate it based on their lunch menu and service staff. Both are pretty good. I like the fact that the food is fresh, locally sustainable, and organic. There's a good balance of meat and vegetarian dishes. In the summer they make a lovely homemade lemonade, and in the fall you can find apple cider. Some of my favorite lunch dishes include: Chilled Seared Organic Beef Salad with Fair Trade Chocolate-Chile Vinaigrette; Pan Browned Alaskan Salmon Burger; and Garden Veggie Burger! Great meals and very filling! I'm also a huge cookie fan - and for dessert you can get a COOKIE SAMPLER!! WHAT?! Oh yeah, it's heaven on a plate!! And if you get the freshly churned Ice Cream you can make your own CHIPWICHES at your table!! LOVE IT!!
14704	3839	3.0	1	2009-01-04	"Three of us had a nice leisurely dinner in a cozy room there last night. The service was friendly.  The climate control was uneven. We started with ""Autumn Spiced Butternut Squash Soup with Braised Pastured Lamb smokey bacon fritter, heirloom apple and walnut salad"" which was NOT a soup.  It was a large fritter (which was NOT fried) with squash sauce.  The sauce was delicious and all of it was too salty. The entrees: * Mustard Grilled Organic Raised Lamb from Neptune Farm with an Oregano-Garlic Chive Pesto Teens for Good Farm's sunchoke puree and organic spinach sauteed with zucchini  - good and the artichoke puree was great * Vegetarian Roundup of Assorted Local Seasonal Vegetables, Pilafs, Salads, and Sides stir-fried, steamed, sautéed and more; served hot and room temperature on one plate - excellent melange but too salty * Low Country Spiced Crispy Pekin Duck Breast from Jurgielewicz Farms Cajun spoonbread, smothered greens, with crawfish etouffee sauce - the best of the lot When we gave negative feedback to waitress, the item was dealt with with grace and top notch customer service. The three deserts were great: * pumpkin cake with apple cinamon icecream * brownie sundae with earl gray ice cream * lime spiced goat cheesecake Be sure to checkout the restrooms"
14705	3839	4.0	1	2008-12-27	You get what you pay for...Absolutely fresh local and organic ingredients. Excellent seafood and meat dishes. Friendly service. Good cocktails. Worth the wait. Happy hour gets out of hand crowded, but dinner here never feels rushed or noisy.
14706	3839	4.0	1	2008-12-22	I like to go here from time to time, for the brie or a hot coffee drink but sometimes the day bartenders rather talk to there friends then make me a drink. I do give credit to the sever who had to come to our cramped table.
14707	3839	3.0	1	2008-12-21	I do really like all that White Dog tries to accomplish.  I love that they are community friendly, hosting events for local non-profits and sustainable businesses.  I also love that they use local and organic ingredients.  I adore the fact that they have a daily (just the weekdays) late night happy hour from 10 to midnight where all their draft beer is half price.  But while some of their food is amazing (the lunch catfish with grits is awesome), some of it is just so-so.  And for $25 a dish, I expect to be wowed.  And while sometimes I'm really excited about my food, other times I leave disappointed.  I never complain when someone wants to take me to White Dog (being a Penn grad student sometimes gets you free food) but when I've got a spare $50 bucks in my pocket, White Dog is never at the top of my list.
14708	3839	4.0	1	2008-11-17	Our party of about 20 was nestled comfortably downstairs in a little dining area to ourselves and we all really enjoyed our meals.  I had the Baked Flaky St. Peter's Fish crusted with Jumbo Lump Crab, Rock Shrimp, and Toasted Almonds and it was very, very good. The menu kind of threw some of us off at first, with starters and entrees on both sides of the page.  Once we got over that, we all loved our food!
14709	3839	5.0	1	2008-11-11	Just tried this place while I was visitting, and man, it's good. The beer selection is good (not superb) with about 8 local-ish microbrews. Had the mushroom strudel and wine-steamed mussels as appetizers. They run out of the strudel right after we got ours, and I was so glad we'd gotten it. Absolutely delectable, but quite small. The crispy pekin duck was the main course, and was delicious. The faro pilaf was absolutely delicious, and melted in my mouth. The meat was tender and delicious. The price was pretty much (about $60 just for me with the tip) but for a locally-grown meal of this quality, I've got no problem paying. Highly recommended.
14710	3839	5.0	1	2008-10-23	I love this place. From the local meats, produce, and fabulous beer to their awesome business practices, this place is such a gem. I'm here constantly, though mostly just at the bar because the dining room is pretty pricey albeit DELICIOUS. Drafts half price after 10. Mmm.
14711	3839	4.0	1	2008-10-17	"There are a few standards that must be met to become a ""Parents Are In Town"" Restaurant: 1. It must be delicious. 2. It must have good beer selection. 3. It must have good service. 4. It must be pricey.  (It's no fun going to a place you can afford to take yourself, right?) White Dog makes the mark on all 4 accounts.   We've been there a handful of times now and have only gotten one thing that was less than tasty (sister ordered a cold soup, and imho, if it's not gazpacho, don't order cold soup).  The sides sound as good as the main dish, in many cases and I've been known to order meals based on how good they sound.  It makes me feel good eating food that is local, organic, etc. and also serves to trick me into thinking its a ""health food.""  Brownie sundaes are a health food if they're organic---ok? Service has always been great.  Last time we were there the waiter honestly admitted that the chicken noodle soup was bland (the boyfriend ordered it anyway and confirmed).  The only bad thing I have to say about White Dog is the lighting.  We were downstairs and three candles for six people just isn't cutting it.  Oh, and I could do without the panhandlers on the stoop too. A solidly good meal with a pretty high price tag, the WDC is one of my faves in town.  (Don't forget to go to the Black Cat to buy yourself something pretty and fun.)"
14712	3839	2.0	1	2008-10-04	I respect White Dog for what it stands for. But the food, frankly, overrated. The space, too crowded. The service, not so great.
8149	3839	4.0	1	2008-09-29	"Back in the early '90's this place was truly innovative - and it still has many, admirable programs and activities.  We nicknamed the White Dog the ""Adjective cafe"". A simple dish of corn frittersmight be labeled as: ""Warm fresh sweet corn and roasted red pepper fritters"" The entire menu was so loaded with adjectives that it was hard to find was the noun was! Anyhow - the food was/is, indeed, very good and many of the ingredients are local or at least regional and organic whenever possible.  I really admire the work that White Dog has done and the viable business they have built. Go, dog, go!"
14713	3839	4.0	1	2008-09-21	I stopped here while visiting my cousin at Penn on my way from D.C. up to Bucks County and enjoyed a great lunch and a pint of Dogfish Head.  The service was friendly, the soup was great, and you can't go wrong with Dogfish.
8048	3839	2.0	1	2008-09-19	I have to say, for all the hype, I fine the 'Dog to be just so-so. I eat here with some frequency as it's the choice of a friend of mine and I'm easy going. But the service during lunch is lack-luster. I do not find hipster kids with attitudes endearing by any means. The portions are small in my book for the price and over all, the food is just mediocre. Until Doug picks another place I might have to continue to put up with it I suppose!
14714	3839	5.0	1	2008-09-17	Went to White Dog for brunch and it was amazing.  I went half-sies with my husband (he got the steak salad, I got the brioche french toast with peach compote) and everything was delicious.  Love to eat local/organic/seasonal, esp. when they know what to do with the ingredients and I was not disappointed. The decor in the room I was in was great.  Dark woods, heavy wallpaper and curtains, very British.  Overall a great experience and I'll be back for more!
8087	3839	3.0	1	2008-09-16	There were many different dishes here, all served with the best intentions - usually with local ingredients, organic or free-range food and environmentally safe or protective fish, etc. They used to have a great steak with mushroom burgandy sauce, but the current menu didn't have that. The garlic mussels were delicious.  The strip steak was a bit tough, but the sauce wasn't bad.  Bluefish was tender, and the vegetables not too salty. Overall, not bad, but the ever-changing menu can be hard to keep up with if you have any favorites that you develop.
14715	3839	4.0	1	2008-09-07	I've only eaten in the dining room part of the White Dog once, and I don't really remember much about the experience. But I do eat in the Bar far more often.  It's so much more preferable to New Deck or a packed Mad for Mex.  After 10PM, draughts are only a couple bucks and the food isn't a greasy mess.  They have some pretty good burgers too.  And they typically have a decent regional beer selection. The bar gets kind of packed in the early evening with the late-worker, quick dinner crew but when it's not packed it's quite nice.
8158	3839	2.0	1	2008-07-29	I've eaten here three times, all while at Penn.  I never had a really good meal here.  The first two times the food was average, very similar to Farmicia in quality and execution. The seating is tight, the waitstaff is generally poor, and the food is average at best.  The waitstaff all three times was extremely poor.  In fact, the last time we saw our waitress three times: orders taken, food brought (we got the wrong entrees brought to our table twice before getting the food we ordered) and when she gave us our bill.  My cheeseburger came without a top bun and I never saw the waitress again to ask for it!   The food is generally okay.  Good burgers and the homemade chips are burnt, but some people like that.  The owner, who I've met a few times, is very eccentric and very eco-friendly both things that flow through into the restaurant.  That's great and all, but in the end a restaurant lives and dies (in my book) by its food and service.  I felt WDC failed in both areas.  Not recommended.  Go to New Deck instead.
12120	3839	2.0	1	2008-07-29	My wife and I had dinner here later towards the end of their service. Service was great and we were seated promptly across from a bunch of loud doctors talking about medical cases...fun. Wine selection was a bit anemic, with only one or two mid-range reds to be had. I ordered the rabbit fricassee; rabbit is typically an under-flavored meat so it relies on the cooking style...instead of braised, it really seemed a little too much like chicken (cliche I know)...the stew it was served in resembled a chicken-stock...again, not terrible, but not worth going out to West Philly for. My wife's  lamb was well cooked and the polenta was not too tacky.  I like that it's local, but local alone didn't make it better. Again, if this was a place around the block I could see dropping by for some comfort food, but it's really not worth the hype.  To be fair, the place had a great location and outside dining seemed quaint enough.
14716	3839	4.0	1	2008-07-19	Expensive, yes there is no denying that dinner at this fine establishment puts a nice hole in the wallet. Worth it? Lets just say you are doing yourself some good by eating this fresh awesome food. The hook on why White Dog is so great is that the food taste better and fresher than many eateries I've known because everything down to the beer on tap, is local! When they run out of a dish, they don't have any frozen in reserve, they use what they order for that evening. And I've never been much of  a collards  fan till I ate here. It's my ma and pa's fave place in Philly, we get some White Dog and when they leave back for Maryland, they hit up some Isgro's. Ah tradition.
14717	3839	4.0	1	2008-07-10	This hippyish food & booze joint delivered a great breakfast, a decent dinner, some interesting beers, and a floor show of locals passing on the street.
14718	3839	5.0	1	2008-07-10	I had to travel to Philidelphia for work and was recommended the White Dog for dinner. The fact of the matter was that I was only in PA for 3 1/2 days and I ended up at this place twice!!! Dinner: Overall pretty good. Nothing super spectacular. They had a lot of vegitarian dishes and I later found out they use local produce. Supporting the local community grants an extra star! Bar scene: The 5 stars is going to the overal ambiance and the fabulous bar scene after dinner. Because it's right down the street from U Penn, it's a pretty chill college bar atmosphere. But the crowd was definitely diverse; professors, students, business peoples, and me ;) The bartender was really helpful as was our server and the drinks were unique and tasty! Everyone was friendly and seemed to be up for conversation. I'm always down with that! Overall, it will be my new favorite bar in PA!
14719	3839	4.0	1	2008-07-06	I've been to White Dog on numerous occasions, and have yet to be disappointed. They only use organic, locally grown, and seasonal items in their dishes, and you can really taste the difference. I've had everything from the seitan to the NY Strip -- mmmm, deeeeelish. The eclectic wait staff is usually very attentive and friendly (I find the service is better in the restaurant than in the bar, unless you're belly up). The atmosphere is charming. And of course, you gotta love a restaurant that believes in local causes and social activism. Sure, it's a little pricey, but a good meal is like a trip to the day spa -- every now and then, you just gotta splurge and give yourself a treat. Don't worry, White Dog. In a world of haters, you still got my lurve.
14720	3839	1.0	1	2008-05-31	i puked at the white dog. why? because the food prep area is visible from the bar, and while sitting at the bar enjoying a pleasant meal and imported beer, i watched the cook pull old greasy fries from the bottom of the fryer, put them in a basket with new fries, and refry the whole batch together. then i looked down at my half-eaten plate of fries. then i went to the bathroom and puked til it was time to leave. everything was great til then though!! except for the fact that it's wicked narrow and awkward to get around in, and that everyone there is cooler than me.
14721	3839	4.0	1	2008-05-22	Peel away all the pretension and the food's interesting and good.  The tables are way too close together and it's too loud!
14722	3839	4.0	1	2008-05-05	i find that i give this place 4 stars more for ambience and service than the food, which makes me sad.  Every time i come here, i want it to be fabulous and delicious.   I mean, it's local, sustainable, and they seem to care....until they cook it.  It's all good, but not fantastic like i want it to be.   The place is a beautifully kept old period property, though.  The cabinets have things stowed in them from other guests.  The windows show out to various parts of street.  the lighting is great, and the dog lamp shades and fixtures along with the doilies with dog patterns are so kitschy that you can't help but giggle at the sight. All the wait staff are trying hard without trying too hard and the experience is always nice (they also have some pretty good beer on tap).  Overall, it's a place i'll keep giving my all.  But so far, the food...well.  Let's just say i'll keep hoping.
14723	3839	4.0	1	2008-04-17	"Kitschy and pretentious feel...but you still wanna eat here!  Wonderfully fresh and delicious, White Dog Cafe is a nod to Alice Waters' ""California cuisine"".  Being from Cali, it was what I expected;  nothing complicated, just fresh food paired well.  The menu changes alot, but I loved the salmon...and the ice cream and ""dog treats"".  Yes, it's pricey, but you really should treat yourself!"
8195	3839	2.0	1	2008-04-03	I just don't get why everyone loves this place, it must be the (comparative) lack of penn undergrads compared to the surrounding spots. The food is generally okay, but if forced to have dinner somewhere within two blocks of the place it would be hard pressed to make my third choice. I had dessert and drinks there (w/Emma A.) last night and our service was beyond slow and then capped off with an error on the check that overcharged us significantly. The only reason we left a decent tip after resolving it was that we were in too much of a hurry to leave to get change. I do have some fond memories of leg lifters to go though, so thats worth a second star.
14724	3839	5.0	1	2008-04-01	Great Beer, great food, environmentally conscious, perfect happy hour (late), and professional service. Just one word of advice, if you just want apps, stick to the bar section, cuz the waiters will be very confused.
14725	3839	1.0	1	2008-03-25	I'm sorry to everyone that loves this place in advance for the one star.  My experience here was at the end of Oct. 2007 so maybe things have changed....I'm a nice person...I really am and it would take a lot for me to give a place 1 star, but here's my two cents. This place looks cute, has a friendly atmosphere, and I was totally digging the organic take on the food.   BUT here's when organic/environmentally friendly crosses the line for me.... I was enjoying a nice overpriced dinner with a guest.  We thought for the price the food is just okay, we've had much better elsewhere.  I had salmon and he had a fillet.  We were seated downstairs, and towards the end of our dinner I see IT.  What is IT you ask?   A HUGE cockroach the size of half my hand crawling up and down the wall above my friends head!  HOLY CRAP I told him to get up because it was crawling towards him.  The two of us stood up away from our table and just stared at it not knowing what to do.  We called the waitress over and told her dude you have a fat ass cockroach crawling on your wall.  By then the cockroach had walked up the wall into the shelf where they stored all the glass cups.  So it was in there mingling with all your cups.  The cups are also placed upside down so I'm sure it touched all the rims.  She apologizes to us and that's it...nothing...we didn't get our dinner comp-ed...we didn't get a discount...and the kicker... NO ONE WASHED THE CUPS where the cockroach walked all over... What are they trying to do?  Conserve water?!  I think in this case it would've been okay to not save the earth for the sake of sanitation.
14726	3839	5.0	1	2008-03-20	Disclaimer: This review is more about White Dog's bar than restaurant. It's befitting that in my final months at Penn, I'd finally yelp White Dog, a place I frequented... probably exceedingly in these past years. Nonetheless, the White Dog bar (separate from restaurant) is probably one of my favorite places at Penn. The solid feel of the counter, the various barkeeps' music in the background, and the relatively inexpensive bar fare keeps bringing me back (here: good conversations with friends = given). The bar menu at White Dog is solid--offering your typical bar food along with the one of the best tasting chicken sandwiches I've ever had in my life.* The succulent chicken sandwich is delicious, but the Cajun string beans that come on the side are even more savory. Fried to a perfect crispy texture and jumbled in a salty-spicy sauce, the string beans are possibly actually the best thing not on the menu. I have ordered the string beans alone...perhaps a better bar food than fries...mildly healthier at least. Aside from that, the happy hour at White Dog is quite good. From Sunday thru Thursday (10 PM - midnight), pints are $2...and this isn't your plebian macro-brew. Instead, you get a fine pint from a local micro-brewery. My favorite is the Troeg's Nut Brown Ale. It tastes like chocolate. Lastly, you can feel good about eating here because part of White Dog's mission includes serving the community and the Earth. Thus, all the food comes from organic local farms and most of the adult beverages come from local sources when possible. *good vegetarian options also available P.S. A little about the restaurant...White Dog has an Americana cuisine. It's pretty tasty and always fresh. A bit pricey and could be more innovative on the restaurant menu. P.P.S. They make strong cocktails.
14727	3839	3.0	1	2008-03-14	Pretty good food (better values on the bar menu, although the limited selection gets old pretty quickly) that places an emphasis on local and sustainable ingredients, which seems to be sorely lacking at many other Philadelphia restaurants.  (Although maybe Cheez Whiz is local.  I'm not sure.) -2 stars for an overabundance of old hippies.
14728	3839	4.0	1	2008-02-22	I was visiting Philadelphia, just having gotten off the Amtrak at 30th St. Station, and we lugged our luggage 10-15 blocks to this place.  It's a pretty cool spot!  The restaurant is built into the ground floor of four different row houses that must be 150 years old.  There's a different dining area in each house, each decorated slightly differently. The food was pretty decent.  They use local and organic ingredients.  But though they release their own cookbooks, the food was good but not spectacular.  I had an Eggs Benedict with lox (they called it something else).  They put green beans on the side, which I found kinda weird but I was in the mood for something lighter so it was nice.  All the ingredients were delicious by themselves, but the plating of the dish had no thought put into it.  Service was prompt and friendly, and our waiter spent time to explain dishes to us. I'm glad we made the long journey with our luggage, though.  It's a pretty fun building to explore, with a lot of fun quirks throughout.
14729	3839	4.0	1	2008-02-16	"I wavered between three and four stars on White Dog... They have decent food and you've gotta love the whole local/organic thing.  Unfortunately, I agree with the reviewer who said the food doesn't exactly ""wow"" you.  I don't know if it ever did, since I'm fairly new to the area, but it's definitely not working any magic now.  It's not a bad place to go for lunch, but I think the dinner menu is overpriced for what it is.  The general consensus among my friends is that the food is stuff that we could probably make ourselves.   That said, the beer selection and bar are awesome.  They have a great selection of seasonal brews and several not-your-usual-bar-selection liquors.  Any place that keeps Hendricks gin on the shelves is OK in my book."
8226	3839	4.0	1	2008-02-14	"I know that White Dog isn't as cutting-edge as it used to be, but I don't care. They have a very good beer selection, and the bartenders can actually, you know, bartend. This is usually a good sign, and White Dog is no exception. The food is very good, and while it's not going to ""wow"" you anymore, just about everything I've ever eaten here has been appealing to both the eyes and mouth. As most people have noted, it's a great date place, and I particularly like sitting in the bar area. In fact, I won't sit anywhere else. It doesn't matter who you are... resident, visitor, tourist, student... White Dog can appeal to everyone and has been in business long enough that it deserves its reputation as a Philadelphia ""institution""."
14730	3839	5.0	1	2008-01-13	White dog brings back great memories.  Every time I go back to Philly, I have to make my pilgrimage to the White Dog Cafe.
14731	3839	4.0	1	2007-11-24	I used to love love this place, but going back multiple times has sort of dimmed my view of it. It's a great date location in University City, but the food is sort of lacking. White Dog has an awesome commitment to using local and organic foods, which I wholeheartedly support. Now if they could only use those undoubtedly tasty ingredients to produce superior dishes.
8205	3839	4.0	1	2007-11-23	White Dog Cafe has been on the University of Penn campus for more than 20 years. It's a comfortable New American (British-styled) pub with canine themes throughout, from the bathroom wall murals to their tasty treat-shaped snacks. They charge a premium for the benefit of providing locally grown produce and meats, and high-quality cooking to their customers. Like La Terrace next door, their menu isn't the cheapest around, but their food isn't bad. Service has always been fine. At the bar I've been helped by Nancy, and in the dining room, Elizabeth served us. Elizabeth taught me a secret handshake which was hilarious! This is a good after hours spot (love the relaxed ambiance) and their kitchen opens late. I've stopped in many times to munch on buffalo wings (not bad, not notable either) and fish and chips. There is ample seating; I have sat in the front, which often gets crowded, and in the rear dining room since our party was large. I've been outside White Dog for festivals where they serve food and block off the street for dancing. No matter where I sit, it's always fun times at White Dog Cafe.
14732	3839	3.0	1	2007-11-20	I ate here on a Friday night. It was nice, but there was none of the emphasis on local foods that I expected, and the decor didn't match up with what is for me a spendy restaurant ($38 = app + entre + 2 beers). The food was good but wasn't specifically distinctive, possibly because we ate vegetarian. But it was exciting to order an entire plate of vegetables! Our waitress was also very thoughtful, splitting our shared dishes onto two plates. I would have liked to try the hot toddys they make with cider, or to have ordered the mussels that my co-diner wanted.
14733	3839	5.0	1	2007-10-16	mmmm... such fond memories of sitting at the bar with my best friend, sipping Hot Apple Pie Toddies after exams or a long night of studying at Van Pelt library! I *heart* White Dog Cafe! It's a good place for a first date if you can get a seat at the bar, which you may have to wait for. It's a great place to catch up with a friend. It's also a great place to bring your mom during your first week of school. Solid food. (Hard to beat organic!) Good salads. Great drinks at the bar! I also enjoyed going by myself for a lunch salad outside on the front porch, to review a lecture before class. Dinner menu is expensive ($20+). Sitting at the bar grants you the right to choose from the dinner menu or the bar menu, which is cheaper and more fun. For dessert they offer many things including plates of cookies, small ($6) or large ($9). Each cookie is different and they're all homemade. Highly recommend! Be careful upon ordering the Kung Pow tofu. I have enormous spice endurance and had trouble after the 5th bite or so. It was made heavy on the chili sauce (a mistake perhaps?). Though I managed to eat most of it, I'd consider it a challenge!
8232	3839	5.0	1	2007-09-18	The first date my husband and I ever had was here.  I loved this place - and that was over 10 years ago.   Right on Upenn's campus, nice tree lined street, I miss philly :(
14734	3839	4.0	1	2007-09-02	We like the food but why won't they let us in??
14735	3839	4.0	1	2007-08-27	The dishes here are always delicious -- fresh, local, seasonal, often organic.  The servers can sometimes get a bit snobby, but the food more than makes up for it.  Definitely check out the bar menu -- it's just as good as the main room, but much cheaper, and the atmosphere is more laid-back. If you're looking for a good nightcap, I highly recommend ordering a Scotch or two and the cookie sampler from the bar.
11603	3839	3.0	1	2007-08-15	The White Dog over charges and under delivers. You are better off just going for a few drinks.
14736	3839	3.0	1	2007-08-10	i seriously don't get why people love this place...  i mean, it's decent.  i've had brunch and dinner there, and yes, it's fresh and organic-y. but my chicken was still too pink for my liking.  and my breakfast burrito-esque thing?  i could probably get that anywhere.
14737	3839	4.0	1	2007-08-06	Delicious, fresh, high-quality food in a casual atmosphere.  Not too terribly pricey. Plus, they're good citizens.  Details on their contributions to the community here: whitedog.com/foundation.….
14738	3839	1.0	1	2007-08-01	I recently went to White Dog Cafe for University City Dining Days and I was severely disappointed.  While most restaurants use Dining Days/Restaurant Week to showcase their restaurant and to bring in new customers, White Dog's menu[while appealing on paper] was disappointing.  I started off with the Prince Edward Island Mussels with Garlic Crostini which I did enjoy.  Next came my main course, Grass Fed Sirloin with Heirloom Kale and Frites.  I have never eaten a tougher steak anywhere in my life.  Two of my companions also ordered the sirloin and they experienced the same thing.  It was like the steak was laced with gristle.  I had ordered mine to be cooked medium rare[it was more medium than rare] yet it was still tough to cut and chewing became an adventure in trying to wash down the last bit of gristle.  Dessert was fine, I ordered the Corn Fritters.  Service was not very good either, we had a guy[girl?] named Rath who wasn't very attentive and pretty much non-existant.  I think it took us 20 minutes to get bread after sitting down.  Overall the group of 6 of us came out disappointed.  It seems that my opinion goes against the majority of the reviews here but I definitely wouldn't go back,  there are just too many other restaurants in this city and to have to risk getting a bad meal again would just be silly.
14739	3839	2.0	1	2007-07-21	I used to go here a lot and went back for lunch on a recent Saturday and was quite disappointed. I git wings which were fair and hubby got chicken quaesidillas whih wer just plain bad- just chicken and cheese. A couple of hours later he got sick and we attributed it to the food. The service was civil though not as attentive as I remember. What happened?
14740	3839	5.0	1	2007-07-18	"I had dinner at the restaurant, and it had great decor, great service, excellent and healthy food. Good place for a nice dinner out with friends or a date even, and the menu is amazing. Surprisingly very ""california cuisinish a la Alice Waters"" in West Philly! I had the chicken which was cooked perfectly and juicy while my friend had the salmon which was also very tasty and not overcooked (I hate when that happens with salmon). The restaurant is not cheap, but definitely a place to check out if you are a foodie. What a great bar menu as well! Not as pricey as the restaurant and still a good selection."
14741	3839	5.0	1	2007-07-09	There are two parts to White Dog, the restaurant itself and the bar.  I can't afford the restaurant but I sure love the bar and the bar food.  If you want good food cooked from good ingredients, go to the White Dog.  It won't be super trendy, it won't be the most beautiful artistic presentation, but you'll leave happily full. The bar food menu is small but reasonably priced and includes their excellent burgers.  Helpings are fairly large.  The beer selection is good and the bartenders are good as well. I like going here on week nights when it is a little less crowded.  You can sit with a friend in the bar and talk and enjoy a good dinner.  Sometimes, especially on Thursday and Friday nights when school is in session, White Dog can get crowded with Penn students from Wharton and the law school.  If they aren't the type of people you like hanging out with you may have to give it a miss.   Disclosure: a friend of mine worked in the kitchen there for many years, but my impressions of the place were made before I knew her.
8228	3839	5.0	1	2007-06-28	I'm a big fan of el Perro Blanco for a couple of reasons.  First, they have great beers on tap and the bartenders know how to make a drink.  Last, their food is quite a big step up from typical bar fare, with some interesting choices alongside great standards like their burger.   Be ready for a healthy dose of neo-liberal propaganda though; its effect on me was mitigated somewhat by the fact that part of said propaganda is to use locally-sourced, all-natural foodstuffs, which clearly leads to tastier vittles.
8252	3839	3.0	1	2007-06-09	My experience with the White Dog was not that great. The restaurant is owned by Urban Outfitter's CEO's ex. She loves the earth, and loves local. So everything you get there is locally grown or raised. Which is great! However, the times I have been there I experienced that the food was not cooked properly, often leaving it dry and tough. Furthermore the seasonings were off, and it was a bit bland. The atmosphere is like Mom's kitchen. It's very cozy and inviting. But unless you are dying for local, you can get better elsewhere.
14742	3839	5.0	1	2007-06-09	I hosted a dinner for a group of 35 here last week in the Dens area.  It was a huge hit.  The atmosphere, service, and food was outstanding.  I couldn't have asked for anything more.
8085	3839	4.0	1	2007-06-02	I CANT AFFORD THIS PLACE! So I had some people take there on my 24th birthday last year. We dressed up as much can be expected for 3 undemployed, underpaid, and undermotivated college grads and entered this bourgeois, liberal, rustic slop-shack. I blushed when I realized the waitress made more than I did and that she knew it on first glance. Swallowing my classism, I ordered a Kentucky Toddy and warmed me with fires of southern HELL and DAMNATION. Possibly one of the most satisfying boozeswallows in my drunken history. Entrees are in the range of a days wages up to a month worth of groceries. I chose the Baked Flaky St. Peter's Fish crusted with Jumbo Lump Crab, Rock Shrimp, and Toasted Almonds steamed snow peas and carrots and creamy tomato dill sauce 25.00. Yes, I just copied and pasted that from the menu. It ruled my world. However, being the guilty ex-veg that I am, I sampled my roommate's Pan Crisped Local Seitan with Roasted Pepper-Anise Coulis cumin-ginger carrots, curried lentil puree 17.50, and it was better than my fish dish. After that we biked to a bar that shall remain nameless in Olde CIty (shudder) where I partook in a substance that shall remain nameless for the first time. The White Dog, a place you want to dine when you are feeling extravagant and upwardly mobile!
14743	3839	1.0	1	2007-06-01	"I'm with Puja. I don't believe the hype about this place. After visiting one of the restaurants they are associated with ""Cabbages and Condoms"" in Bangkok, I was expecting more. We went a few weeks ago with our 9-month old baby and a student of mine who was celebrating his 10th birthday. We sat in the back room (highlight since it was cozy) and the babe was fine. However, the 10-yr old was treated like a misfit when he asked questions about the food.  The food was overpriced in my book, based on taste and quantity. Plus side: interesting options and good presentation. The kicker: poor 10-yr.old was not even invited to enjoy a cupcake or dessert, though they knew we were there for his birthday."
14744	3839	1.0	1	2007-05-16	Ok I must be in the minority here but I think the food at White Dog is gross.  My boyfriend and I went for lunch.  I had the steak salad and he had the veggie burger - and neither of us liked our food.  The lettuce in the steak salad had wilted and the meat was way overcooked.  Not to mention the fact that my food had NO TASTE.  I was really disappointed considering it's supposed to be a University City staple.   However, the ambiance is great.  I love the rooms and the cozy feel.  Unfortunately, the food needs a LOT of work.
14745	3839	5.0	1	2007-05-11	"GAH I wish the White Dog Cafe was in a different location!  I loved it there, but there would be few instances that I'd find myself in that area.  As it was, we were going to see Jon Stewart at the Tower and lord knows there's not much in Upper Darby... From the outside, the White Dog is adorable - a cute brownstone (or actually a few of them) with a little patio with outside seating (first come, first served.)  But when I walked in, I was...uh...a little worried.  The dining area looks like Cracker Barrel.  (ok, not THAT bad.  But its WAAAAY country, with the checkered tablecloths and windsor chairs.)  It screams ""family restaurant - beware of sticky menus.""  But it's not that at all. So IMO, the menu didn't match the decor.  Like previously said, everything organic, local if possible.  Hormone free meats.  AND it was great food to boot, the menu was inventive.  (I'm sorry, I am yelping this a few weeks after the fact and so don't remember our meal exactly, so I'll just say it exceeded our expectations.)   My FAVORITE, though - and this might not strike people the same way it does me, but - when you order (organic, fair trade certified) coffee, they bring you the little ramekin full of what would normally be sugar and Equal/Sweet 'n Low, but theirs is only cane sugar or STEVIA.  I love it!  Stevia in a restaurant!  There was no chemical sweetener offered and that just won my heart.  I would go back to this place just for that reason alone. ;-) So unforts this place is totally out of the way for anything we'd want to do.  Even though it's not that close to the Tower, we'll make it our dinner before the show place whenever we have something going on there."
12179	3839	4.0	1	2007-05-10	My husband I discovered the White Dog Cafe by accident when we first moved to Philly, but it proved to be a most pleasant surprise.  Be prepared to spend some bucks when you go, but also be prepared to receive excellent service, unique menu choices, and a good time.  I'm also greatly impressed with the social and business ethics that fuel this establishment.  And, yes, do check out the Black Cat store while you're there for some fun and zany goodies.
14746	3839	4.0	1	2007-03-27	this place is great, especially if you have vegetarians with you. another one of philly's great lunch spots.
12183	3839	4.0	1	2007-03-26	White Dog Cafe is a great brunch place.  It had been ages since I'd dined there, and it was as tasty as I'd remembered.  However, they are getting only 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4) because of the weird/ unprofessional service we received.  Our waitress seemed as if she had a) never been trained on how to be a waitress, b) never dealt with the public before and c) didn't know how to brush her hair.  Despite this, the convenience of a no-wait brunch on Sunday morning (11:30ish) will bring me back for another meal.  However, I might just tip in combs and hair product instead of cash.
8099	3839	1.0	1	2007-03-20	"When you goto this place you gotta realize your in the suck. UPENN kids as far as the eye can see...sweating through the walls, making you itch. When you walk in, the bar area is set up a little funny.  Its a square bar, but on the back half of the square there's a open-mini-kitchen-grill-prep station-thing going on. But its not like a classy japanese steakhouse open-prep-station... this is more like a ""Hey, whats that dirty looking fat guy in raggedy clothes doing with those pots?""kinda station. Which left me kinda skeptical about what the main kitchen area looks like.... but anywho... Me and the girl got the menu and everything on it looked pretty acceptable.  The soup was more than decent, and the greek plate had an out of control amount of feta cheese on it (is that good or bad?).  The girl got the marinated tofu pita and said it was eh... and by ""eh"" she meant dry and not worth 9 beans. It might be one of the better places to eat/drink on UPENN campus, but since UPENN is a joke, that's not saying much. We'll probably make it back again since west philly in general is pretty weak when it comes to dining out but i'm not gonna cut off my tongue with industrial scissors if we don't. Alrite,  this place used to have three stars, but i just dropped it down to 1, and im completely done here.  Ive been here atleast 3 other times since the initial reveiw and was disappointed everytime. . ugh... ."
14747	3839	4.0	1	2007-03-19	Fantastic restaurant in West Philly. Fresh ingredients and creative menu. White Dog Cafe is the kind of place that you recommend to non-Philadelphians for a nice dinner. Check out the bathroom art too.
10741	3839	5.0	1	2007-03-09	It's been a long, long time and I'm glad I made it back to the White Dog.  A lot of good memories around the area of which it is one.  Glad to see it's still around after all these years.  Shared the herb salad and had the Mahi Mahi with Shrimp for the main course.  My friend had a vegetarian stir-fry dish.  Both were outstanding.  On another occasion, also sampled the Organic Florida Shrimp and Crawfish Tail Fettuccini as well as the Grilled Organic Portabello sandwich.  Had some excellent microbrews too.  Might have had a few too many of those on one occasion.  Many more dishes to try and also desserts.  Just an outstanding restaurant, food and aesthetics-wise; cozy and comfortable.
14748	3839	5.0	1	2007-03-06	Every time I eat here, I want to order everything on the menu. Thats' the only downside -- you have to chose one thing from what is always an interesting and eclectic menu. Any place with Victory Hop Devil on tap is a place worth spending some time near. New Years day pajama party is a treat.
8261	3839	4.0	1	2007-02-26	White Dog Cafe is best known for it's creative delicacies and warm atmosphere.  With main courses like Troll Caught Spiced Roasted Mahi Mahi Filet and  Low Country Spiced Crispy Pekin Duck Breast, you simply can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  A little expensive, but definitely worth a visit.
8262	3839	4.0	1	2007-02-15	I've always preferred black dogs anyway. But the White Dog is a great restaurant that gets national love, and stays in contact with the nation (through their stellar mailings). The food is all organic. It's excellent, and the menu changes. The crowd is lively and sophisticated. The service is of the highest rank. I love the ambiance. It feels like you're at a dinner party you'd never want to leave, and I'm somebody who hates those sort of functions. I find that this meal and experience is cherished every so often... I stand by it, and I need to use it more frequently for lunch.
8199	3839	4.0	1	2007-02-03	How did I forget to yelp this?  Good food, comfortable atmosphere, and friendly staff.  The food is fresh and creative, yet still comforting and familiar.  Good for casual brunch, dates, family gatherings, or even drinks at the bar with a little nosh.  Truly a Philly landmark. Update: recently had deplorable service here, so bad that I may not return.
12186	3839	4.0	1	2007-01-28	The White Dog cafe is a pretty cozy little restaurant if you can stomach an abundance of Penn Students.  Their food is high quality, much of it organic and Earth friendly.  The outdoor seating is nice too when it's not ass-numbingly cold outside.   I like grass-fed meat, organic vegetables and whole grain options available on a restaurant menu.  I'm also a big fan of small plate dishes, which White Dog has available in abundance.  If it weren't in U-City, I'd probably find myself there more often.
14749	3839	3.0	1	2006-12-10	Not as good as it use to be. When Kevin ran the kitchen the place had some of the best food in the city with a great crowd of people. They still have good late night bar food here and fabulous home made ice cream, but the sit down meals are not worth the price in my opinion. I strongly support the  liberal causes the management stands for and Judy Wicks is a poineer entrepenuer in West Philly who opened up the White Dog when Sansom Street was nothing more than few lonely row house across an empty open field from Penn.
12185	3839	4.0	1	2006-11-13	A cute, quaint cafe on Penn's campus. I had a delightful brunch at White Dog on a recent trip to Philly. Reasonably priced brunch cocktails and generous portions (I had the vegan breakfast burrito). Service can be slow, but it's great for a long, leisurely meal.
8259	3839	4.0	1	2006-11-04	If you drive an old Volvo and still proudly display a ratty Gore 2000 sticker on the bumper, you'll definitely love the White Dog.
14750	3839	5.0	1	2006-11-01	A hung-over impromptu train ride to Philly, in the rain, on a random Tuesday,  to this wonderful, wonderful haven! White Dog Cafe!! Our vegan, lactose-intolerant, and  dairy-and-whey-allergic friend recommended us this place. She said it's expensive and local, organic, amazing, oh and it's a great-for-a -date place. And my friends did think the veggie plates were lovely! the White Dog is a converted from a large old Victorian on a cobblestone road, as apparently many of the restaurants are in Philly! The ceilings are high and glassed in the main room and some rooms have a very cozy comfy feel. There is a maze of country elegant rooms and seem fit for wedding. ABSOLUTE PUMPKIN FEST, EVERY COURSE I had local organic free range Lancaster Chicken (first time ordering free range out) a little dry but very satisfying out of this world stuffing with pumpkin, fresh greens. I had localish (Delaware) Dogfish Head Pumpkin Ale (standing  #1 in my pumpkin ale contest, I've tried six so far) oh and Pumpkin for desert. Profiteroles and Brownie with Pumpkin stuff in each and delicate ginger ice cream in expensive place portions. Good Coffee. i felt a little sicky before I came to White Dog, but rich southern, hippy, grandma made it all better. ;) :) :)
14751	3839	5.0	1	2006-09-21	Oh, how I miss the White Dog. 4 fruitless years spent slaving away in Philadelphia and the only thing I learned was the glory and the greatness of the White Dog Cafe. The food, spectacular. The ambiance, charming. The staff, warm and welcoming. But the best part? The attached store, The Black Cat. Open late, packed with gems AND a selection of wacky hats? Yes, indeed. Stuffed and drunk, I'd select scented soaps and greeting cards and plastic chickens, peruse cookbooks and earrings and ceramic bowls covered in polka dots and peonies. I'd shop forever if I could. Well, I'd eat forever if I could, then I'd drink forever if I could, but given a third and final option, I would shop. And that, folks, is why I will forever treasure my time at the White Dog Cafe...
14752	3839	5.0	1	2006-09-02	Great place to check out at Upenn campus. They have their bar menu (which is what I ordered from) and their regular menu, which has more pricy entrees (mid 20's and up). The bar menu had some pretty good burgers/sandwiches as well as some other entrees that are in decent portions. I started off with chips and guacamole... for 5 bux, it seems like a pretty good deal for two people. For the entree, I had the Organic Florida Shrimp and Crawfish Tail Fettuccini. It was covered with spicy parmesan cheese cream, sweet onions and tomatoes. Delightful to my taste buds. For dessert, try out the Peach Cobbler. The peach tastes natural and the ice cream/cookie is filled with good flavor. And all of that was about the same cost as one of the regular entrees! Check out this place if you're on campus.
14753	3839	4.0	1	2006-07-17	Personally, I don't let politics interfere with my dining experience.  I generally discourage political, philosophical, or religious discussion at the table no matter the company.  The only exception to that rule is whether is a discussion of the religious or philosophical food or wine experience.  Then we're on. As for the White Dog...It feels like home.  There's few places more inviting during the winter to eat heartily, drink well, and enjoy the atmosphere.  i
14754	3839	5.0	1	2006-07-09	I echo the accolades for White Dog but wanted to add the info on their Happy Hour Sun-Thursday nights from 10-midnight.  All of their delicious beers are only $2!!! which is quite a discount from usual $5 draft prices.  At Happy hour, pitchers are usually about $8 as well. Also wanted to comment on my eating experiences here.  My boyfriend got  mussels once and the waitress graciously took them off of the check after we explained how they were not even really open.  My roommate got the cold celery soup (i know sounds gross) and the waiter took it off of our check for no other reason than that she didn't like it.  I hope no one abuses this, but the staff is very understanding...
8278	3839	5.0	1	2006-05-17	Great, delicious food.  Also, White Dog holds various political events here, such as lectures and documentary screenings.  They're free, check them out!
14755	3839	5.0	1	2006-04-03	The white dog is hands down my favorite restaurant.  Its charming, cozy, healthy, delicious, and if you are even thinking about going to Philly, you'd better put this down on your list, or you're gonna miss out... and if its getting cold out, order the seasonal hot toddie drinks.  Any one of them is bound to warm even the coldest of hearts.
14756	3839	4.0	1	2005-09-15	Great, fresh, organic salads and dishes in a cozy cafe near UPenn.  Try the white dog tapas platter of the day!
14757	3839	5.0	1	2005-08-18	Excellent food. Amazing ambiance. Stellar service. Plus they're environmentally and politically conscious. Went to a great seminar about drug education which included a three course dinner. Highly recommended!
14758	3839	5.0	1	2005-06-24	"It is an absolute honor to be the 1st reviewer for White Dog.  This is hands down one of the best eats in West Phila (located 1 block from UPENN).  The restaurant is broken into various rooms that have this homey vibe to 'em that makes you feel safe and warm and squishy all over.  White Dog single handedly made the winter in Philly seem bearable since it opened my eyes and heart to the Tuaca hot toddie.  The amish grilled cheese sandwich is my fave tho really any dish is an organic/orgasmic experience.  If someone asked me ""I have one meal in West Philly, where should I go?""  I'd say without hesitation, ""White Dog."""
14759	4177	1.0	-1	2012-09-02	Dry turkey Reuben with minimal sauerkraut & dressing.  Unfriendly staff at counter.  I tried to suggest some customer service training to the manager for the young lady at the order counter; but it was not well received.   Two sandwiches and two fountain sodas $21 (no chips).  Although it is a beautiful spot, I won't go for lunch again.
14760	4177	4.0	-1	2013-09-13	Good turkey burger (with actual REAL cheddar on it), but sadly you have to buy fries separately. Ice cream is pretty standard but a bit pricey. What really makes it here is the view of the Lake. Absolutely gorgeous.
14761	4177	4.0	-1	2012-01-26	This place is a winner. Only in the summer though. They've got the best creemees around. The Black Raspberry is amazing, and the Maple is outrageous. The view is killer. Count on incredible panoramas of Lake Champlain from their deck with some of the best sunset views around. There are a couple of reasons that I didn't give it five stars. The first is the long lines and disorganized ordering process if you attempt to get food here. The second is the quality of the food. It's nothing out of the ordinary. Basically, if you're looking for a meal, expect to wait a long time and get food that's a little overpriced, and generally average. Maybe that's not such a big deal though since the view is so good.
14762	4177	4.0	-1	2011-08-10	The mushroom and goats cheese wrap is delicious and their maple creemies are the best Ive ever had!!
14763	4177	5.0	-1	2012-05-17	I love this place! The food is always great, and the staff are very friendly. I love the turkey burger, the lobster bisque, and the maple turkey BLT.
14764	4177	5.0	-1	2010-03-11	One of my favorite joints in Burlington. I love BB in the summer, sitting on the back deck and just watching the lake. Best food around, and the ONLY place to go for ice cream!
14765	4177	3.0	1	2014-10-15	The market is cute, the food is decent, and the price is reasonable. But the service leaves something to be desired. You go up to the counter and place your order and pay, then go sit down. They bring you your food when it's ready - seems pretty standard? Except they have no way of knowing who ordered what, so the servers just wander around asking random tables if they ordered the item currently being delivered. It doesn't make sense, because there is a stack of numbers beside the cash, but they don't seem to be used, ever. You can take one if you want, but it's in no way attached to your order, so it's really just for show. It's something that could be so easily remedied, but not doing so means longer wait times for customers, and often, cold food. It's a great location, with a beautiful view of the lake, but making this one change could really make a world of difference.
14766	4177	4.0	1	2014-10-04	Burlington Bay definitely covers a lot of bases. It is in a great location overlooking the lake with both indoor and outdoor seating. They have decent sandwiches but people mainly go for their creemees (aka Vermont's word for soft serve ice cream).  It's almost like a rite of passage into summer. My personal favorite is the maple black raspberry twist. They also have a small grocery inside as well as a Vermont Liquor Outlet, though you can't buy from the outlet and consume on the premises. This place is popular with the locals and is a great stop for out of town folks being so close to the hotels by the waterfront. Watch the sun set over the lake while enjoying a tasty Vermont creemee. It's the perfect way to end a day in Burlington.
14767	4177	5.0	1	2014-09-21	The creamee here was excellent. I got the maple syrup creamee, which may only be a limited time offering? But I enjoyed it very much. It was not too sweet and a bit sour. It reminded me of frozen yogurt and ice cream. It tasted very fresh with a hint of fresh maple syrup. This is how soft serve should taste. Not like that overly sugared stuff you get from Mr Frostee.
14768	4177	5.0	1	2014-09-19	The best Creamees in Burlington, hands down!  Very thick and excellent flavor.  Friendly service too. Vermont Maple Creamee is highly recommended! So delicious!!!! Next time I am getting sprinkles on my creemee.
14769	4177	4.0	1	2014-09-06	"This is where I had my first maple creemee thanks to a local in the know by the name of Blanka :) What is a ""creemee"", you say? (I had never heard of it either) In the words of Burlington Bay, ""The term 'Creemee' is just a Vermont born word for soft serve ice cream! It seems like the definition should be more complex, but it really isn't!"" Here's the mini scoop on Burlington Bay based on my one hour visit: -Creemees sold at the window (""legit creemees"" as I am told - the difference is in the milk fat content if I remember correctly?) -located on the waterfront with great views and a deck -they offer catering and a wide selection of Vermont beers and wines"
14770	4177	4.0	1	2014-08-22	My cousin took my husband and I here because she likes their sandwiches. The store is pretty cute located in Burlington and walking distance to Lake Champlain.  It does have a market setup with some grab and go grocery items, but also a sit down section for a bite to eat. My husband ordered a turkey BLT with maple bacon which he said was delicious and I had fish tacos which were fresh and a manageable size. My husband ordered a local beer which has been his favorite so far this vacation, Switchback. I tried a really good root beer, made in New York. They are pretty fast making our made to go orders. Didn't get a creemee from here because I felt I had just the right amount of lunch.
14771	4177	2.0	1	2014-08-11	Lets start with the positive. The food was good. Not great but better than some and worse than some. The staff was friendly and efficient, the service was relatively speedy. The downside for me...sticker shock. 2 sandwiches, 2 bags of chips, 2 drinks, over 30 bucks. One of the sandwiches was even the special of the day. My boyfriend and I ordered our food, paid the hefty pricetag and went to find a table on the deck. We were pretty hungry so needless to say our chips were gone by the time the food arrived. Seeing a lone sandwich on a plate, delivered to your table, after paying 30 bucks kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth no matter how good the food is. I understand that restaurants on the waterfront have a premium retail location and no matter what, someone has to pay for that. I think this is just a case of perceived value to the customer. Maybe add fries for 1.99 or toss a few chips and a pickle on the side, throw me a bone here. Good but too costly to go back when there is another great sandwich place across the street with a little more bang for your buck. Pay the cheaper price and walk to the waterfront, that is free.
14772	4177	2.0	1	2014-08-10	There is a lot to say about Burlington Bay and not much of it is good.  I have worked closely to this place for years and so have limited choice when in a hurry for a quick bite. The food itself is often passable but be prepared for a light layer of grease or cross contamination if you get anything from the grill.  While the employees are nice enough, I can't say the same for the management- a hot or cold reception is the norm.   The biggest downside is pricing: tuna on a small bun with one leaf of lettuce and a tomato is $7.99. Add on a drink and tax and your are looking at a $14 lunch...Simply put the only reason this places continues is because of the location and our visitors from the north who have a favorable exchange rate. Too bad really, it could be great with better management and pricing.  Trust the local reviewers and steer clear!
14773	4177	5.0	1	2014-08-06	Best creemees in Burlington! Hands down.
14774	4177	4.0	1	2014-08-05	Excellent maple creemees and they've got a liquor store!
14775	4177	4.0	1	2014-07-28	A good place to grab a bite by the waterfront. You order your food at the counter inside and then are given a number to put on your table and can sit anywhere inside or outside while you wait for them to bring you your food. They are usually pretty fast with the food, and I don't think I've ever had to wait more than 10 minutes for mine. There is a patio outside that has water views with a bunch of tables to choose from, most of which have umbrellas, which is nice for when it's really sunny. I pretty much get the turkey burger and fries every time I go and think it's one of the best turkey burgers around...probably because of the cranberry mayo they put on it. Fries are good too. After eating there is a little window around front where you can order creemies, which are also really tasty. Occasionally I have also called and ordered take out, so that is an option too here.
14776	4177	4.0	1	2014-06-15	Surprisingly good food and a great view. I love the BELT for breakfast. It is easily the best breakfast sandwich in town.  The blackened salmon is really great for lunch or dinner. The staff is always friendly and efficient.
14777	4177	3.0	1	2014-06-01	"I came here years ago, but didn't really remember the experience much. Today, we decided to stop by for a ""Creemee"" (For those of you from outside of Vermont, this is exactly ""Soft-serve ice cream"". Vermonter's will try to tell you ""Creemees"" are different, but they're not). I had a chocolate soft-serve which was fine. A medium was too much for me to eat on my own, so I'm glad I had help. My helper had a double scoop of Island Ice Cream's chocolate and he had some toffee pieces put on top. Nothing wrong with either. We sat outside and most people seemed to be pretty respectful. There was one table full of young girls who were chatting loudly but that was it. It was a little expensive. I gave my boyfriend a $20 and two ice creams resulted in me getting a $10 and some change back. I didn't pay so I don't know what the exact amount was. There was absolutely nothing wrong with getting ice cream here, but it wasn't exactly the most memorable experience either."
14778	4177	5.0	1	2014-05-11	This is my favorite of favorite places to get a creemee in Burlington! If you don't know what a creemee is you better learn fast-run, don't walk to get one. Creemees are Vermont's version of soft serve but we don't use that word here. Make sure you head on up to the window and order yourself a delicious CREEMEE and make sure to ask for sprinkles (the appropriate term for those little colorful toppings on your ice cream that I believe taste like chalk). The  at this place the Creemees come in your standard chocolate or vanilla but you can also get a maple one or a black raspberry. The best part- you can actually get two flavors of creemee as a mix. Check it out!!!
14779	4177	5.0	1	2013-09-24	Maple cremees.  Amazing, and I don't particularly like ice cream.  Super delicious and I recommend them to everyone who takes a walk around the lakefront!
14780	4177	5.0	1	2013-09-05	Get the black bean burger, it's great.  Great place for a light or not so light meal overlooking the lake.  The Creemees are terrific (I was put off by the price at first, but they are thick and worth it).
14781	4177	4.0	1	2013-09-01	I had only been here for ice cream with my family and was not aware of a great lunch selection.  The salmon burger was great!  They have a small kids menu, but a variety of sandwiches, burgers, drinks and other goodies.  The location is wonderful for a date or time with family.
14782	4177	3.0	1	2013-08-09	Went here for quick breakfast, had the egg sandwich- Portuguese roll was very good although Bacon thick cut not crispy, came with home fries. Very nice shop and service, not sure would call the food healthy but was the best hot grab n go option I could see.  Would consider for lunch as that menu looked healthier.
14783	4177	4.0	1	2013-08-07	Nice view. Nice food. Good simple choice for a sunny day. Italian sub was pretty good. Tried part of a pastrami sandwich too and it was good. Everybody enjoyed their lunch.
14784	4177	5.0	1	2013-06-29	Flavor tried: Gary & Pam both enjoyed Vermont Maple Black Raspberry Twist. Scrumptious natural flavor and lovely color.  Very creamy texture, a unique location  near Lake Champlain, waterfront attractions & UVM. examiner.com/review/summ…
14785	4177	3.0	1	2013-06-08	"We stopped by Burlington to wait for the flight. The extensive patio overlooking the bay is hard to miss. Indeed, it was quite an enjoyment sitting under the sun on the patio with breeze from the bay. We ordered Steak and Cheese and Italian Sub, simple sandwiches, surprised to find that there was no fries on the side though. However, the steak was tender and Italian was delightful. We didn't know the maple creemees were famous - obviously we didn't know what ""creemee"" was. Inside the restaurant is spacious. The white-painted walls and blue roof reminds me of Mykonos in Greece."
14786	4177	5.0	1	2013-05-18	The have the best creemees around.  Try the maple creemee!
14787	4177	1.0	1	2013-04-09	"After being a loyal customer for years they took a dive on me.... We had gone down with dinner at the waterfront the other night. I was excited to find out that the creeme stand was also open for the season! But the customer service here took a dive on us. For starters we ordered 2 small creemes on a cone. The sign said $2.50 before taxes. However they charged me $7.18. After doing the math I pointed it out after we had paid and the girl at the stand said ""Taxes""...Yet taxes in Burlington are 9 - 10 percent...Go figure? After a few moments of thinking about it I went back up to let their manager know. After doing this I pretty much left after being told that I was wrong nicely. Not sure what math class they take... I didn't want a refund I was just letting him know as a paying customer and I got the feeling he could care less. There for customer service is a major issue. Don't get me wrong their creeme's are great! But with bad customer service I will find my creeme else where. Stay clear of this place. Even though I was only charged over a dollar more what its worth its more about the principle! Bad managers/staff can make or break a location for me. So much for loyalty meaning anything these days."
14788	4177	5.0	1	2012-10-25	Best egg sandwich hands down, enough said.  Well I guess I'll say a little more, I had the classic Bay Market egg sandwich, and then returned 2 days in a row.  It helped that my hotel was just 2 blocks away but I couldn't get enough.  Something about the Portuguese english muffin made all the difference.  If I ever make it back to Burlington I'm definitely hitting up this place again.
14789	4177	2.0	1	2012-10-20	Stay away from the veggie Sandwich. I just think for a town that is so veggie friendly they could do a better job and make at least one decent veggie. Everything else is good and the cree-mees are to die for!
14790	4177	4.0	1	2012-10-04	After a recommendation from a friend I decided to go here and I am quite happy that I did. They have relatively cheap hamburgers that are very good. Also the sandwiches are a bit on the pricy side but are excellent. They also give you a sandwich card so it kind of works out price wise. You get 1 sandwich free after you buy 5. Its also a kind of weird overall store with a liquor store in it which I was not expecting when I walked in. Its convenient if you are trying to get some liquor and sandwiches at the same time. Overall its expensive but the food is quality.
14791	4177	3.0	1	2012-08-22	Never my first choice, but the location and variety is a convenience. Good place to grab a quick bottle of wine for a dinner party or a soft-serve ice cream cone after a walk on the water in the summertime. The eatery is overpriced and the food always takes too long, but it's decent quality.
14792	4177	3.0	1	2012-08-16	First it gets 3 stars for the location and the coffee.  We were staying at the Hilton which is one hill up from the market.  It was easily accessible and the staff is friendly.  However, friendly does not mean efficient.  We went there on a particularly not-too-busy hour.   We ordered a bagel with cream cheese and waited, and waited, and waited.  There were only two other customers in the market.  We went back to the counter and inquired.  Our bagel had been sitting in the toaster.  Yup.  Even better is that they did not toast a new bagel for us but gave us that one and there wasn't a heartfelt apology.  We decided that complaining wasn't worth it.  I have read that other people have had better experiences so perhaps it is hit or miss.
14793	4177	4.0	1	2012-08-13	I ventured here for breakfast and lunch on to separate occasions while staying at the Burlington Hilton. The advantage is that this place is right across the street from the hotel and easily accessible from anywhere on the Lake Champlain/Burlington area. Note: if you are out earlier than 8am for breakfast, this place is open. I walked to the Skinny Pancake and they did not open until 8am so for early birds, this is your place! It serves as a walk-up food order diner, where they bring the food out to your table. It also serves as a market of sorts where you can buy a few fruit items and grab some snacks for on-the-go. There is inside seating as well as outside seating that overlooks Lake Champlain! You can't go wrong here! The food is made of fresh and local ingredients and is super yummy! For breakfast there are many egg plates, sandwiches, or bagels. For lunch, there are hot and cold sandwiches as well as fresh salads and wraps! This is a great place to stay on the healthier front of dining out while travelling! I was super thankful to have found it early on my trip!
14794	4177	4.0	1	2012-07-14	We were driving through Burlington on vacation and needed to stop for lunch.  We could not find a McDonald's in Burlington.  We had no idea where to go.  I must be the only person left on the planet without a smart phone to check.   But my dumb luck got us to Burlington Bay Market and Cafe.  It was a good thing we stopped here.  The food was good!  The wife got a cheeseburger.  The daughter ordered a hot dog, and I ordered a pulled pork sandwich.  The wife cheeseburger was big and good.  It was a lot more hamburger than most fast food joints.  The daughter's hot dog was very good as well.  She finished the whole thing!  We later found out that they use  a McKenzie's all beef jumbo dog.  Mckenzie's is supposed to be famous in Vermont.  The pulled pork sandwich was okay.  My homemade pulled pork is lot better.  It's a good thing I didn't have a smart phone.  Otherwise, I would have gotten the crab cake sandwich and a creemee for dessert.  But, then again, I may have ended up somewhere else.
14795	4177	5.0	1	2012-04-07	Get a maple creamee! Awesome views of the lake! GO :)
14796	4177	4.0	1	2012-02-06	I would give Burlington Bay 4 stars just for the Creemee's alone but since that only open in the summer's we'll have to move onto food. The Crabcake sandwich here is the best I've ever had. It's just so juicy and hearty with the right amount of zesty creamy sauce on top. Now that I think of it, I would like one right now! Now, back to the creemee's. Lots of places around Burlington sell creemee's... Al's, Rocky's Pizza, etc. But Burlington Bay give you these Gigundo portions! My fav is the Black Rasp/Maple Swirl, Mmm Mmm Mmm! I want a Crabcake Sandwich and Creemee now!
14797	4177	5.0	1	2012-01-27	This place is top eatery in my opinion for lunch and early dinner. View on patio during summer can not be beat. Lobster Bisque Cajun Tuna Sandwhich thats my order. My advice do that order at least once you will be hooked. Little pricey but seafood is good quality. They serve beer and wine too which is nice. So good. Great selection. Love this place.
14798	4177	4.0	1	2012-01-15	Burlington Bay feels like a hipster designed a convience store. There's a nice well-designed deli, a nice windowed seating area and deck, a small liquor store, a fresh seafood counter and very tiny local foods section all in a deceptively small space. Oh, and I think there's a creemee window somewhere too. The deli is the star of the show here, with unique vermont-inspired items on the menu. While you can still get the classics like a burger and fries, the menu is small but decent. My personal favorites are the two always-in-stock soups. While they do have one or two soups-de-jour, the Lobster Bisque and Clam Chowder are hands-down the best soups I've ever eaten in my life. I dunno how they do it in the middle of Vermont, but you will never get a better seafood soup, and the portions are healthy too. All in all, not cheap, but very good food. I'd reccommend them for a good lunch any day of the week. I think they do breakfast too, but I'm never up that early.
14799	4177	3.0	1	2011-07-09	"The crab sandwich is pretty good, though it's served on a big soft roll, way bigger than the crab cake. The bread kind of overwhelms the crab cake. My husband had the chicken club and reported it was tasty. We tried the ""creemie"", too - that's soft-serve ice cream - and while nice, nothing out-of-the-ordinary. They do offer doggie ice cream cones though, and that must be worth a few stars, right?"
14800	4177	3.0	1	2011-05-21	Salmon sandwich is so so good, but the prices are very high and overall the food is a 3 out of 5.  Best views of the harbor though!
14801	4177	4.0	1	2010-11-15	"This place may confuse newcomers some as the name is accurate: when you first walk in you think you're in a small ""Market"" but as you walk further you discover the counter and grill for the ""Cafe"".  I recommend the food, it's very tasty.  I don't think they offer anything real special but it provides GREAT views of the lakefront and a relaxing atmosphere to drink some coffee and nibble on a good omelet in the morning.   They probably could use a larger indoor seating area (despite having a HUGE outdoor deck to eat from on warm days). Definitely a must stop for those coming from out of town or state.  You'll also be able to pick up beer or wine on your way out!"
14802	4177	4.0	1	2010-10-18	"Beautiful views of Lake Champlain and downtown Burlington, hearty and delicious soups and sandwiches, plus those amazing maple creemees! Aside from the lackadaisical service, this place is worth checking out. (More on that later. But I'm docking one star from this review.) First, those soups! The four on the menu were beef and vegetable, New England clam chowder, lobster bisque, and pumpkin squash. I was able to taste every one but the chowder, and all were fantastic. The bisque was extremely rich and full of succulent lobster, the pumpkin squash was fresh and seasonal, but my favorite was the beef and vegetable. (Good thing, because that was what I ordered.) My husband let me try his crabcake sandwich and it was one of the best I've ever tasted -- heaps of tender crab, loosely bound, served with lettuce and tomato on a nice soft bun spread with a spicy remoulade for a zesty kick. The logistics of Burlington Bay Cafe are simple. Order at the counter inside, pay for your order, and take the proffered number to your table. (You bus your own soup and drinks.) Servers will eventually come and deliver your sandwiches and side items and take back the number. Here's where it gets tricky. Whatever you do, don't let the servers take your table numbers if they haven't completed your order. When our sandwiches arrived, the server took our numbers and said, ""I'll be right back with your fries."" Twenty minutes later, I decided to go and check on the progress of said fries. The first question was, ""What's your table number?"" My reply: ""I don't remember. They took the table number when they delivered the sandwiches."" This was followed by blank stares, the riffling through of order slips, questions to the cooks, and finally a shrug and a promise to deliver the two missing orders of fries at some point in the future. After another ten minutes or so, the missing fries appeared and were promptly devoured, although the sandwiches they should have accompanied were long gone. But, I have to admit, they were still really good - crisp, hot, and kissed with malt vinegar. Be sure to save room for those creemees. I'm not sure why they're called creemees, instead of soft serve ice cream, but they are really, really excellent. You order at an outside window, pay, and then take them to go, or just return to your seat. I prefer the outside deck facing the lake if weather permits. Maple is the preferred flavor, but they also offer raspberry, vanilla, and chocolate. And a small is big enough to share!"
14803	4177	3.0	1	2010-09-07	This is the review of the market and liquor outlet. I regret not trying their creemes and food. I was in here quickly to grab bottles of water and local wines. I walked into their section of liquor outlet. The wines were not stock in the liquor outlet. They were stock separately nearby the groceries.  As for the liquors, they had a good selection of the premiums. As for the wines, they just had a tiny bottom shelf of Vermont wines, four or five bottles.  I was disappointed for the Vermont selection but they had a great selection of wines of california and everywhere else. I ended up buying Vermont cheeses, poland spring water bottles, and lake champlain chocolate bars. I found the water and chocolates to be overpriced. I paid 2.99 for a 3oz choc bar. That's the price you pay for on the go and convenience.
14804	4177	4.0	1	2010-08-10	My favorite casual lunch spot when I'm in town for work. It is very relaxing to view Lake Champlain from this spot.  On a good day you can eat outside on their porch facing the lake.    I usually get two meals out of each sandwich, as the portion size is generous.   Lots of variety at their market.  They used to have a good bakery too, but I think they've curtailed that.   The maple creemee is a favorite here.  Parking is difficult from Battery Street during peak hours; it is best to park further away and walk.   The waterfront is inviting.
14805	4177	5.0	1	2010-07-12	For the soft serve (creemee) ice cream.   Had maple and chocolate.  Nice servers.  Great view of lake.
14806	4177	4.0	1	2010-07-01	Maple creemies on the waterfront! Haven't had the food here but a trip to Burlington (or even Vermont) is not complete without a maple creemie from Burlington Bay.  Occasionally they have black raspberry creemies which are also top-notch. Get your creemie at the window then make your way down to the waterfront for a stroll on the boardwalk.
14807	4177	5.0	1	2010-02-08	This crabcake patty is the best thing I've ever eaten in between bread!  Perfectly crisp on the outside, fresh tomatoes and lettuce, some lemon juice, mayo, and a soft bun. Best. lunch. ever!
8023	4177	4.0	1	2009-09-07	This is a very good market to pick up quality items to cook at home or for a prepared take away. The sandwiches are very good and fresh. The salads are also noteworthy. The baked cookies and brownies are always tasteful and moist.
14808	4177	5.0	1	2009-07-21	Love it! Kids menu could have more choices... But awesome every time. Lobster bisque is incredible! Good sandwiches. A little pricey - but you can't put a value of this view.
14809	4177	4.0	1	2009-06-28	Good food and very quick. Fantastic view of the lake without the high prices or long wait of some other dinner spots. Crab cake sandwich was fresh and very tasty.
14810	4177	4.0	1	2009-04-01	"Burlington Bay is a local cafe' on the waterfront. In the summer they have deck seating with a beautiful view of the lake and sunset, along with 2 icecream windows(I recommend the Raspberry flurry with toffee bits, large cup its only $4.50-ish.) Burlington Bay has a large selection of cold and hot beverges, deli deserts, indoor seating,Sea food, sandwiches and soups. Beer/wine is also available. Burlington Bay is dog friendly, serving ""doggie icecream"" and doggie treats inside."
14811	4177	5.0	1	2007-05-09	The Burlington Bay Market & Cafe is a great casual dining spot.  It's right at the corner of the entrance to the waterfront and the Echo Center.  As the name implies it's more than just a cafe but also a market with a deli, lots of drinks, and chips and other food items. I love the atmosphere here because I love quaint little casual dining spots.  I admit it may not be for everybody but I love it!  Once you place  your meal grab a seat at one of the many round tables and enjoy the view of Lake Champlain from your seat.  A waitress will bring you your meal when it's ready. The food is somewhere between that of a grill and sub shop.  The cafe specializes in sandwiches and the like, but also has soups, and sides.  The average sandwich runs between six and nine dollars.  However, I'll point out the most expensive item on the menu is the Lobster Salad sandwich that costs $14.99.  I personally recommend the Chicken Club it's quite good and a favorite of mine. There isn't much to the customer service.  You walk up to the cafe's counter and place your order.  Then you find a seat and your order will be brought to you when its ready.  The staff are indeed friendly and provide a positive experience, but aside from placing your order there's not much interaction with them. Additionally, if memory serves me correct there is a window next to the entrance where they serve ice cream during the summer.  I don't remember though. While there is a parking lot be prepared to park down in the waterfront parking lot if you come here during lunch time.  The parking lot fills up quickly!
14812	82	1.0	-1	2012-07-11	They are sooooo rude, they don't bother to acknowledge you when you walk in and could care less if you're ready to order. Don't bother to get delivery because you'll die of starvation before they show up. To top it off they aren't even that great for the prices they charge. Look elsewhere for food!
14813	82	1.0	-1	2011-12-02	The staff here is very rude and the pizza is very greasy! Will never get my business ever again. Really like the NY-NY pizza on franklin ave.
14814	82	2.0	-1	2012-01-15	"Love the pizza.  The owner Jonnie was shot at there once. Still has the bullet holes in the wall to prove it. Great guy. Ask for him when you call! The pizza is great. Thin crust and no shortage of cheese. They use solid ingredients and you won't be short changed at all. A large 3 topping pizza runs 22 dollars but worth it. I'm writing this review because we have been running into a bit of hassle over there. Suddenly now they won't get out of the car to deliver the pizza. Yea it's Hartford but we live in a decent area. Why would you expect a girl to run into the middle of the street to get a pizza? Not safe for anyone.It doesn't come on time anymore. 30 min wait turns into an hour almost. Last week when I ordered it the driver claimed he had already been by and I would have to wait again. Problem with that story was that I was outside waiting the whole entire time and he never showed up. When I called because so much time had elapsed...he asked me for directions to my house. Really?!  Then when I said I wasn't waiting another 20 mins he said fine and took off-no pizza. Ended up going out to eat at the lovely Macaroni Grill. Campus Pizza is so great that I have been getting pizza from there since day one. Last night when I ordered it the driver stayed in the middle of the street again and yelled at me that he had been calling me. I took out my cell phone to prove he had not made a single call. They wrote the number down wrong when I called in. I called the numbered they had and it was an incomplete number. SO YEAH, DON'T be yelling at me and saying you have been calling when A-you did not call, and B-you just literally pulled up C-you were really late in getting here D-you're in the middle of the street and not delivering my pizza in a safe manner E-you are yelling F-lieing and blaming a customer that just simply wanted a freaking pizza and G-I gave you a 3 dollar tip because I had 25 dollars intending that I was going to get the good service I used to get. What happened to such a delicious place? The end of the story-a sweet kid got out of the car and told me they didn't have the right phone number. Great kid, great pizza. Moral of this story is if you want your pizza-pick it up from here. Otherwise-something's up with the delivery driver now. I won't bother anymore and don't recommend it. Signed-x sad customer. And ps...what's the story with saying ""we don't get out of our cars to deliver anymore.""  ??????? They were just sitting in the middle of the street-didn't even pull up to the curb. Oh, and I forgot to add-one of the other writers was correct-at times they do charge mystery prices. I am sad this pizza is still in my system from last night."
14815	82	3.0	-1	2011-09-20	Its actually pretty decent. Its much better than public school pizza and going to NYC for a pizza might end up getting you killed when 9/11 part 2 : revenge of osama happens. Its not the best I've had (Deep River Pizza is in Deep River CT) but its defintely worth a shot
14816	82	5.0	-1	2011-06-07	Great pizza, I am embarassed that I haven't discovered this earlier!
14817	82	3.0	1	2014-07-21	QUALITY PIZZA Definitely the best delivery so far.  And open LATE NIGHT  Real cheese delicious crispy crust  soft on inside. Large greek salad generous feta. Easy ordering. Speaks clear english. Costs a little more than other pizza places. Is worth it. Quality   Despite bad press. I ordered. I took into accord dates. I'm glad I gambled. It's hard to find a late night pizza with REAL CHEESE :)
14818	82	1.0	1	2014-03-03	"Pizza is average but it's really the staff that ruin this place. Placed an order, waited an hour to only have half the order arrive. Waited for another quarter order to arrive but they forgot the soda. They came back with the soda to tell me they didn't have a credit card slip for me to sign only for me to see they had written my entire credit card number including 3 digit CID on the order form! Guy says, ""I'll charge when I get back."" Get a call half an hour later, the guy had switched the digits and they needed my card. I asked whether they were still charging me full price as it took an hour and a half and the pizza was cold when it arrived. The response I got? ""You got your food right?"" Just wow. Only order as a last resort unless this is the experience you crave. I've had delayed deliveries before where the driver goes to the wrong address and calls but is halfway across the city but it seems to have somehow gotten even worse. Order earlier from somewhere else if you want hot pizza."

14820	82	3.0	1	2011-12-15	"I think the large cheese pizza is an absolutely heavenly take-out choice when it's late, you're drunk, or you just want some simple fatty comfort food. Cheap and tasty. Hot tip: always check prices and confirm the totals with your own math. They used to try to rip me off when I was a college kid years ago, and I guess they're still at it. This time's offenses: charging $4 extra as a ""special topping"" to add pineapple to half a pizza, which no one else seems to consider ""special""; charging mystery prices for everything I ordered, all of which differed from the online-posted menu -- dated 2011 -- and blaming it on the web designer. In that vein, be prepared to pay a buck extra for using a credit card -- or, better, stick with cash."
14821	82	1.0	1	2010-10-17	This place isn't very good. Like most pizza in Hartford, it tasted cheap. Doughy and soft, not much sauce or cheese. It's like public school's pizza
8076	82	2.0	1	2009-05-05	"I can't believe I used to eat this.  Actually, on balance, it makes perfect sense that a drunken college kid used to eat this.  For four years I subjected myself to this ""pizza,"" if for no other reason than to remind myself to get the hell out of Hartford, get back to New York and have a real slice of pizza.   In a pinch; however...an alcohol induced pinch...Campus Pizza gets the job done."
14822	84	1.0	-1	2010-11-01	It's a poor knock off. I don't do imitations, especially when everyone there is fake to your face to make a sale. Smile aren't everything
14823	84	3.0	-1	2014-01-16	Sigh, I like this place but have to say, I got sick of cops cutting in front of me in line at the deli for lunch.
14824	84	4.0	-1	2014-06-21	Been going here for years! They usually have whatever I need and at a really good price for the Orange Street markets. Cheese is a little expensive, but I guess it is everywhere. Super, *super* friendly staff!
14825	84	4.0	-1	2013-08-16	Orange Street Market is better than Nica's and the other one. They could have better fish (or like any fish lol sometimes they're out). And better bread or a head of broccoli when you need one. But still, they are killing it with the egg & cheese. The milk selection is solid. The staff is a joy, if a little leisurely.
14826	84	4.0	-1	2011-11-11	We really like the P&M Orange Street Market! My wife and I moved across the country and felt a strong lack of community in New Haven. When we found P&M, we were so happy to have so many friendly people and such a great selection of produce at a small market. Also, if you're looking for good antipasti, P&M has great cold cuts and amazing blue cheese stuffed olives. This is definitely one of our favorite places to go for a good grinder or pannini as well. All of the sandwiches are fresh and affordable. If you live near Orange street and are looking for a great deli/grocery, P&M is definitely the way to go!
14827	84	5.0	-1	2013-07-22	"In terms of little-city-big-taste, P&M is as good as it gets. The staff is very welcoming & friendly, and there is none of the get-in-and-get-out feeling to some of the other local spots. Their meat counter is very fresh, and they have great daily deals. I highly recommend their store-made sausage - delicious! Their steaks are not too fatty, and the chicken is always fresh. I have not yet tried the fish (aside from the stuffed clams which were very good). They have a wide selection of fruit and veggies, and also a number of different cheeses (they carry raw milk as well, which is a bonus in my book!) They have speakers outside which makes their patio a great place to sit and enjoy the day. Sometimes the checkout line can be a little long, but frequently one of the employees will jump in and open the second register to help out. They also recently installed a points system - sign up for one of the ""Spot"" cards, and each time you make a purchase there scan the card. The points will add up and you can apply them towards future purchases :). All in all, A+ for P&M for great sandwiches, fresh veggies, and service with a smile."
14828	84	5.0	-1	2011-12-03	I love going here.  Even after moving out of the area, I still stop in to get a meal or some great stuffed chicken breasts.  I walk in and the staff still stop to say howdy to me. Best bacon egg and cheese sandwich I've had since Me'n'u closed down. The prices are good compared to the other stores and if I ever need a cooking tip, they're right there with suggestions.
14829	84	5.0	-1	2011-07-17	I got my party catered by P and M. When I went in for a tasting, everyone was extremely, genuinely friendly, definitely not fake. The food was delicious. We tried the broccoli bread, pepperoni bread, tomato and mozzarella salad, potato salad without eggs, and my dad tried the sausage and peppers, since I am a vegetarian. Everything was phenomenal, and we ended up getting all of it for my 45 guests. Two trays of everything plus baked ziti was only around $400, which was much less than the other places I was considering charged. My guests LOVED the food, and it was gone pretty quickly! Some time in the near future I definitely want to stop in for just a sandwich.
14830	84	5.0	-1	2011-01-30	I believe P&M is the best market on Orange street because it is not just about the great people they have working there and their environment inside the store. It is also  the wide variety of items that they have in the store, their well prepared food,  the way they are organized, and the little of Italy that they have in every corner of the store. Their is never one day that I go and see people leave the store without a smile on their face.
14831	84	5.0	-1	2011-01-28	I love to go to P&M and always find a new item on it's shelves! The place is in constantly adapting to it's customer necessities; you can make a sugestion of any item you are looking for and that you always buy it and they will  try it to get in for you... Also their deli and prepared dinners are just DELICIOUS!
14832	84	5.0	-1	2010-11-08	I just love the simplicity of the place and the food: meat, fish, peanut butter, cheese, bread, deserts, apples, wonderful sandwishes, frozen tamales... But above all, i enjoy the way they treat me with a smile and old-fashioned manners.
14833	84	1.0	1	2014-12-10	"I've been shopping here since I moved to New Haven 3 months ago and was always impressed with how friendly and helpful the staff was. I shopped there recently and was overcharged $300 for $30 groceries. This caused my bank account to overdraft but the cashier was completely unsympathetic or apologetic. They ""refunded"" me the difference but the next day, I still hadn't been refunded. When I went back to speak to a manager, it turned out the cashier WAS the manager and she was equally rude to me as the day before. I won't be shopping there again. Luckily there's a few corner markets on the same street."
